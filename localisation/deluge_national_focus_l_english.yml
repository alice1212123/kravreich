 deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."
 deluge_individualism: "Individualism"
 deluge_individualism_desc: "The human spirit is fragile. Demagogues and tyrants would crush it for the sake of their grandiose visions. We cannot allow this."
 deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"

 deluge_league_leave: "Leave the League of Nations"
 deluge_league_leave_desc: "Perhaps it was too utopian to think we could settle our differences when surrounded by such hateful enemies. We should end our participation in the League of Nations."
 deluge_architects: "Architects"
 deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."

 deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."

 deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"

 deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 france_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"

 france_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 france_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 france_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 france_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."

 france_depose_monarch: "Depose the Emperor"
 france_depose_monarch_desc: "Napoleon IV is a relic of the past. His ancestor helped sweep away the old order and then inexplicably chose to replace it with new monarchs and emperors beholden to nothing but their own whims. We must resolve this contradiction and put an end to the power of absolute monarchies. Let him retire or send him into exile; whatever happens, France needs him gone."
 france_league_of_nations: "The League of Nations"
 france_league_of_nations_desc: "'In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, the Contracting Parties agree to this Covenant of the League of Nations.'"
 france_league_prohibit_poison_gas: "Prohibit Poison Gas"
 france_league_prohibit_poison_gas_desc: "The Great War proved the horror of poisonous and asphyxiating gases. We should propose a Convention to ban their use."
 france_league_international_court: "International Court of Justice"
 france_league_international_court_desc: "The primary aim of the League of Nations will be to ensure peace. The primary organ through which this aim will be achieved should be a permanent court to arbitrate disputes between members."

 france_league_relief_union_desc: "The International Red Cross have requested that we propose the creation of a disaster relief organisation."
 france_league_prisoners_of_war: "Prisoners of War"

 france_punish_britain: "Punish Britain"
 france_punish_britain_desc: "Perfidious Albion is at it again! By attempting to restore their place as the pre-eminent European power, they have sealed their doom. Versailles was too good for them - we must prevent Britain being a threat to us ever again."
 france_punish_poland: "Punish Poland"
 france_punish_poland_desc: "First to fight indeed. The Poles were smashed by French armies in the Great War and almost succumbed to civil unrest. Only our benevolence and mercy left them with as much territory as they still possess. And still they seek to wage war! They have lost the right to independence."
 france_punish_russia: "Punish Russia"
 france_punish_russia_desc: "Ever an expansionist power, the Russians have once again become a threat to the peace of Europe. By securing the independence of the subject nations in Byelorussia, Ukraine, the Baltics and the Caucasus, we thought Russia too weak to attack her neighbours. We were wrong."
 france_punish_japan: "Punish Japan"

 france_punish_turkey: "Punish Turkey"
 france_punish_turkey_desc: "We saved the Turks from annihilation at the hands of Russia in the Great War. And yet now they seek to expand at the expense of our allies and spherelings. We must put the Turks back in their place."
 france_punish_austria: "Punish Austria"
 france_punish_austria_desc: "The delicate balance of power we established in 1817 is once again under threat, but this time from our Great War ally. The Austrians have been our foes before and suffered for it. We will show them why they should have sought our friendship."
 france_punish_germany: "Punish Germany"
 france_punish_germany_desc: "The Germans were given enormous leeway before the Great War, with their conquest of Swedish Schleswig-Holstein and Wettin Saxony going unpunished by the Emperors. We gave Germany an inch and they have now taken a mile. We have to stop these continued German aggressions for the good of Europe!"
 france_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 france_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 france_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence.

 france_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment.

 france_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."

 great_britain_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 great_britain_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 great_britain_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 great_britain_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 great_britain_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 great_britain_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."

 great_britain_claim_port_africa: "Portuguese Africa"
 great_britain_claim_port_africa_desc: "Portugal was awarded most of the African territory stolen from us at Versailles. We must show the world that the British Empire is still a force to be reckoned with by retaking our imperial possessions."
 great_britain_claim_ireland: "Claim Ireland"
 great_britain_claim_ireland_desc: "The protestants in Ulster cry out for liberation from their Papist oppressors. Though we lost Ireland to French intrigues a century ago, we have never forgotten our duties to the Ulster Orangemen, and we will now fulfil those duties through force of arms."
 great_britain_claim_canada: "Claim Canada"
 great_britain_claim_canada_desc: "Britain agreed to adjust her colonial borders in North America at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War. Bourbon France received the former Canadian territories in exchange for Michigan and Ohio. Since then, the surviving Bourbons in Louisiana have managed to lose 'Quebec' to nationalist separatists. We can use this opportunity to our advantage."
 great_britain_claim_carribean: "Reconquer the Carribean"

 great_britain_befriend_portugal: "Align Portugal"
 great_britain_befriend_portugal_desc: "Our alliance with Portugal was one of the oldest treaties in history, until the Great War shattered all common sense. Bullied by the Spanish and French, the Portuguese were turned against us through no fault of their own. We should offer them a place in the Commonwealth to prevent the French abusing them in the future."
 great_britain_coastal_forts: "Coastal Fortification"
 great_britain_coastal_forts_desc: "The English Channel is a significant obstacle to invasions, and our warships should be our primary defence, but not our only defence. We should build a series of bunkers, pillboxes, barracks and magazines near important landing sites to make conquering our motherland a more difficult prospect."
 great_britain_befriend_spain: "Align Spain"
 great_britain_befriend_spain_desc: "Britain and Spain fought on opposite sides of the Great War, and France rewarded her ally with several pieces of the broken British empire. Ceylon, Egypt and Gibraltar are lost and we need to accept that and move on. We should offer the Spanish an alliance against the French - they will surely be pleased at the prospect of regaining Catalonia."
 great_britain_depose_monarch: "Abolish the Monarchy"
 great_britain_depose_monarch_desc: "The monarchy is an obsolete, feudal institution. The people are the source of the state's legitimacy, and for one family to claim special privileges is an attack on the idea of equality before the law. No more tithe barns, no more droits of the crown, no more duchies: long live the Republic of Great Britain!"
 great_britain_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 great_britain_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 great_britain_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 great_britain_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 great_britain_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 great_britain_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 great_britain_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 great_britain_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 great_britain_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 great_britain_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 great_britain_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 great_britain_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 great_britain_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 great_britain_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 great_britain_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 great_britain_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 great_britain_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 great_britain_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 great_britain_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 great_britain_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 great_britain_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 great_britain_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 great_britain_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 great_britain_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 great_britain_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 great_britain_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 great_britain_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 great_britain_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 great_britain_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 great_britain_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 great_britain_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 great_britain_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."

 russia_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 russia_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 russia_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 russia_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 russia_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 russia_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 russia_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 russia_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 russia_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 russia_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."

 russia_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 russia_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 russia_deluge_form_soviet_union: "Form the Soviet Union"
 russia_deluge_form_soviet_union_desc: "The many fraternal nations of the former Russian Empire must be united under one state so that the industrialised areas can assist the rural areas, the politically advanced proletarians in the cities can educate the peasants, and to create a stronger government and military that can resist the attacks of the bourgeois and reactionary powers who oppose us."
 russia_deluge_defeat_rasputins_influence: "Defeat Rasputin's Influence"
 russia_deluge_defeat_rasputins_influence_desc: "Rasputin's insidious grip on power must end. We have already undone some of the reactionary policies he enforced on the Tsar during his regency, but more must be done to root out the Black Monk's hucksters and charlatans infesting our civil service and damaging the legitimacy and efficiency of the Russian state."
 russia_deluge_embrace_black_hundreds: "Embrace the Black Hundreds"
 russia_deluge_embrace_black_hundreds_desc: "The Black Hundreds are a paramilitary ultranationalist group who seek the revitalisation of the nation. Opponents say they are thugs, murderers and pogromists, but the Russian state could make use of their bold initiative in order to shake up our moribund Stavka."
 russia_depose_tsar: "Depose the Tsar"
 russia_depose_tsar_desc: "We've suffered under the backwards monarchy for long enough. The reforms to strengthen the nation and improve the people's wellbeing have come too slowly and too late. Now the Russian people will take matters into their own hands by throwing off the Romanov dynasty and forging their own destiny."
 russia_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 russia_claim_baltic_desc: "The old Duchy of Courland fell to revolutionists 70 years ago. Virulent republicans with no respect for law and order had the audacity to try to rule themselves, without the stern guidance of their betters. While we attempted to liberate the Baltics from misrule during the Great War, we failed, and the most despicable of Jacobins took the opportunity to seize power. We must undo our recent mistakes."
 russia_claim_byelorussia: "Claim Byelorussia"
 russia_claim_byelorussia_desc: "The territories of White Ruthenia were a particularly outrageous theft on Napoleon I's part. Emperor Alexander II attempted to recover the provinces in 1860, but their meddling neighbours opposed us and won the field. The 'nation' of Byelorussia must be reincorporated into Russia!"
 russia_claim_ukraine: "Claim the Ukraine"
 russia_claim_ukraine_desc: "Of all the former territories of the Russian Empire, the Ukraine is the most distressing for the Russian people to behold. While the various Cossack princes and hetmanates were an acceptable neighour, the recent upheavals of the Great War have resulted in bloodthirsty anarchists seizing power and committing heinous crimes against nature and order. Their continued atrocities must be ended!"
 russia_claim_caucasia: "Claim Caucasia"
 russia_claim_caucasia_desc: "A recent loss, not attributable to Napoleon's bloodlust, the Caucasian provinces rebelled during the Great War, although they had been stirred up by rabblerousers for some time prior. Our armies in the area, sad to say, frequently sided with the rebels rather than restore order. We thank the Saints their betrayal did not cost us all of Russia. Even so, we must put an end to this union of the Caucasian nations."
 russia_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 russia_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 russia_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 russia_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 russia_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 russia_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 russia_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 russia_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 russia_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 russia_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 russia_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 russia_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 russia_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 russia_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 russia_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 russia_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 russia_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 russia_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 russia_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 russia_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 russia_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 russia_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 russia_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 russia_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 russia_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 russia_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 russia_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 russia_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 russia_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 russia_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 russia_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 russia_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 russia_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 russia_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.'"

 russia_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 russia_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 russia_deluge_land_management_agency: "Land Management Agency"
 russia_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 russia_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"
 russia_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 russia_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 russia_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 russia_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 russia_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 russia_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 russia_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 russia_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 russia_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 russia_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 russia_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 russia_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 russia_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 russia_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 russia_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 russia_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 russia_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 russia_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 russia_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 russia_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 russia_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 russia_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 russia_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 russia_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 russia_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 russia_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 russia_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 russia_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 russia_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 russia_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 russia_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 russia_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 russia_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 russia_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 russia_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 russia_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 russia_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 russia_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 russia_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 russia_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 russia_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 russia_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 russia_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 russia_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 russia_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 russia_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 russia_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 russia_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 russia_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 russia_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 russia_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 russia_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 russia_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 russia_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 russia_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 deluge_pomeranian_populism_focus: "Pomeranian Populism"
 deluge_pomeranian_populism_focus_desc: "Pomerania has been the plaything of empires for too long. The people must be liberated from the scheming and murderous sovereigns."
 deluge_mandate_institutions_focus: "Mandate Institutions"
 deluge_mandate_institutions_focus_desc: "Our time under the French Mandatory government gave us the space to develop our own institutions with which to rule ourselves while turmoil gripped Poland and Germany. Our city councillors will serve as legislators in a stable Pomeranian democracy."
 deluge_kashubian_nationalism_focus: "Kashubian Nationalism"
 deluge_kashubian_nationalism_focus_desc: "The Kashubian language is related to Polish, but our customs and history diverged centuries ago."
 germany_deluge_a_morning_in_berlin: "§R A Morning In Berlin §R"
 germany_deluge_a_morning_in_berlin_desc: "Rubble and ash cover the streets in grey while hallowing screams echo through the city streets. None can slumber into their dreams and each mind is alight with fear. This is the reality of this dreaded civil war and the quicker we end it the safer our children and wife's will be."

 poland_abolish_monarchy: "Abolish the Monarchy"
 poland_abolish_monarchy_desc: "Poland does not need a constant reminder of our subjugation to France walking around the halls of power. We should remove Augustus IV's privileges and end the last vestiges of feudalism in our nation."
 poland_form_poland-lithuania: "Form Poland-Lithuania"
 poland_form_poland-lithuania_desc: "A century ago, the ancient union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was destroyed by the treachery of her imperialist neighbours. Napoleon restored some of Poland's autonomy but she never regained her past size. Today we can announce to the world our restoration of Poland's borders to those of the old Commonwealth."
 poland_balkan_diplomacy: "Balkan Diplomacy"
 poland_balkan_diplomacy_desc: "We must go on the diplomatic offensive! We need allies for protection and spreading our influence, so we should try to bring our nearby neighbours to our way of ideological thinking. We can use radio propaganda, newspapers, party donations, and civic organisations."
 poland_befriend_croatia: "Align Croatia"
 poland_befriend_croatia_desc: "Croatia was able to expand at Serbian expense following the Great War, making her a more powerful and useful ally. We should bring her into our faction."
 poland_befriend_serbia: "Align Serbia"
 poland_befriend_serbia_desc: "The Serbs were our loyal allies in the Great War. They bore much of the brunt of the Treaty of Versailles, being reduced in size to a rump state. With the Serbs by our side, we will have our revenge!"
 poland_befriend_austria: "Align Austria"
 poland_befriend_austria_desc: "The Slavic peoples within the Austrian Empire were the casus bellum for our initiation of hostilities in the Great War, but perhaps the Austrian victory demonstrates the Czech, Slovene and Slovak peoples are better off as constituents of Austria. We should set aside our past differences."

 poland_destroy_bulgaria: "Destroy Bulgaria"
 poland_destroy_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgarian king, who arrogantly styles himself 'Tsar', sided with the French during the Great War. Securing the approaches to Constantinople was a great boon to the Continental System's war efforts. We should punish Bulgaria by inviting our allies to assist in carving her up. The Romanians will also surely want a share of the spoils."
 poland_destroy_romania: "Destroy Romania"
 poland_destroy_romania_desc: "Our Hungarian allies dealt stinging blows to the Romanian kingdom during the Great War, but it was not enough to stave off defeat. Now that the dust has settled, let us finish what we started by dismembering the Romanian state between ourselves and our allies. We can also entice the Bulgarians to assist with the promise of recovering Dobruja."
 poland_claim_czechia: "Claim Czechia"
 poland_claim_czechia_desc: "The decadent fools in Austria have long held our Slavic brothers in bondage. Most were able to escape that moribund embrace during the Napoleonic wars, but the Czechs still languish in feudal servitude. We must liberate all the Western Slavic peoples under the banner of Poland."
 poland_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 poland_claim_baltic_desc: "The Lithuanians were not always members of the Baltic union, nor Russian subjects. Before the Deluge struck Poland in 1655, the Lithuanians were equal partners in the glorious Polish Commonwealth. We will revitalise the Lithuanian national spirit by bringing them back into the Polish orbit."
 poland_claim_byelorussia: "Claim Byelorussia"
 poland_claim_byelorussia_desc: "The Slavic peoples share close ties and this is especially true for Poles and Byelorussians.

 poland_claim_ukraine: "Claim the Ukraine"

 poland_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 poland_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 poland_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 poland_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 poland_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 poland_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 poland_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 poland_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 poland_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 poland_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 poland_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."

 poland_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 poland_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics.

 poland_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 poland_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 poland_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 poland_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns.

 poland_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 poland_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."

 poland_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 poland_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 poland_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 poland_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army.

 poland_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 poland_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 poland_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 poland_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 poland_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 poland_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust.

 poland_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 poland_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 poland_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 poland_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 poland_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 poland_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 poland_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 poland_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 poland_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 poland_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 poland_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 poland_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 poland_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 poland_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 poland_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 poland_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 poland_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 poland_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 poland_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 poland_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 poland_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 austria_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"

 austria_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 austria_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 austria_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 austria_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 austria_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 austria_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 austria_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 austria_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 austria_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 austria_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."

 austria_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"

 austria_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 austria_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 austria_appoint_hitler: "Minister-President Adolf Hitler"
 austria_appoint_hitler_desc: "The far-right politician Adolf Hitler has unusual racial beliefs which we disapprove of, but he is a very energetic politician and a good public speaker. We should secure his loyalty by appointing him Minister-President, the Emperor's senior executive official, bringing his supporters into the fold of the establishment and neutering them."
 austria_abolish_monarchy: "Revoke the Imperial Privileges"
 austria_abolish_monarchy_desc: "Otto I's time is up. Whether he goes into exile or retirement, he must cede all his power to the government of Austria. We cannot have a feudal relic ruining our plans."
 austria_claim_croatia: "Claim Croatia"
 austria_claim_croatia_desc: "Croatia was part of the old empire after its nobles chose a Habsburg as their protector in 1527, following wars with Turkey. While the specific lineages of dynasties may be muddied, our role as custodians of civilisation remains clear. Let us assume the role of protector of Croatia once again."
 austria_claim_hungary: "Claim Hungary"
 austria_claim_hungary_desc: "The Crown of Saint Stephen passed to a Habsburg following Turkish assaults on Hungary. The realm remained in union with Austria until they first merged into the Austrian Empire in 1804, and then were split again following the final victory of Napoleon in 1817. Since then, Hungary has gone through periods of instability and warfare, proving themselves unsuited for independence."
 austria_claim_italy: "Claims on Italy"
 austria_claim_italy_desc: "Milan and Naples were annexed into the Habsburg empire at the conclusion of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714. Later, they were separated from Austria by Napoleon, and combined with Venice and the Church states to form the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians claim several regions of Austria even today, so we should strike at them both in pre-emptive self-defence and to right past wrongs."
 austria_claim_poland: "Claims on Poland"
 austria_claim_poland_desc: "Silesia was an Austrian territory until its loss to the now defunct Kingdom of Prussia. Napoleon defeated Prussia and created the puppet kingdoms of Westphalia and Poland, also seizing West Galicia to turn Poland into a large land power. The Great War showed the folly of this, as Poland laid waste to much of Europe. We must reclaim Silesia and West Galicia for European stability."
 austria_independent_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 austria_independent_faction_desc: "Vast lands constituted the former Habsburg realms, which were held in union until the onset of the Napoleonic wars and then merged into the formal Austrian Empire (which our nation is the legal successor to). Those vast lands nowadays lack strong leadership and moral guidance. We can help them achieve good governance once more, by restoring the old borders."
 austria_unify_germany: "Unify Germany"

 austria_greater_austria_desc: "The Hungarian and Austrian peoples enjoyed union within the same state in the past under the Habsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire. With Hungary once again under our benevolent but firm rule, we can integrate their lands into our state by extending the basic privileges of Austrian citizenship to the Hungarian and Croatian peoples."
 austria_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 austria_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 austria_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 austria_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 austria_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 austria_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 austria_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 austria_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 austria_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 austria_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 austria_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 austria_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 austria_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 austria_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 austria_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 austria_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 austria_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 austria_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 austria_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 austria_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 austria_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 austria_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 austria_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 austria_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 america_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"
 america_deluge_aristocracy_desc: "Those with a long term interest in the country should rule: families with good breeding and a long history. Commoners would destabilise the realm with their short-sighted demands and rabble rousing."

 america_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 america_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 america_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 america_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 america_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 america_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."

 america_deluge_kkk: "Jim Crow Laws"
 america_deluge_kkk_desc: "The obvious inferiority of the Negro is written plain as day in the Bible, in the natural sciences, and in our observances in everyday life. Why fight against what is natural? We must pass legislation to restrict the rights, movement and speech of national minorities. Local segregation ordinances will serve as our template."
 america_deluge_race_relations: "Equal Protection"
 america_deluge_race_relations_desc: "The freedmen have been abused by kluxers and lynch mobs for too long. We must mete out punishments for lawbreakers even if they have the tacit support of local government and corrupt policemen. The law will not be flaunted and the injustices of racial discrimination will end."
 america_depose_monarch: "Depose King John"
 america_depose_monarch_desc: "Two hundred years ago we tried to rid ourselves of monarchies but failed. The American Revolution was defeated and the kings returned. Is an American-born tyrant any better than a foreigner? Remove King John II's powers and return power to the people."
 america_manifest_destiny: "Manifest Destiny"
 america_manifest_destiny_desc: "Providence provided us with the opportunity to spread over the entire continent. We were stymied by rebellion and unable to achieve the greatness we deserved. Now, with the passing of the turbulence of the Great War, the opportunity has arisen once more: the Eagle must spread her wings from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea."
 america_claim_quebec: "Claim Quebec"
 america_claim_quebec_desc: "The rabble-rousing Quebecois rebelled from their former sovereign several decades ago. Since then, things in the Quebec republic went from bad to worse. The radicals who ravaged the nation after the Great War need to be punished for their sins against the natural order."
 america_claim_louisiana: "Claim Louisiana"
 america_claim_louisiana_desc: "The exiled French king was not welcome in his old realm, and he is not welcome in the Americas. The French are an inferior race, and the Louisianans are an especially backwards specimen. They barely understand democracy and constitutionalism. We must liberate them from their ignorance."
 america_claim_deseret: "Claim Deseret"
 america_claim_deseret_desc: "The heretic Mormons to the West fled persecution at our hands and forged an unholy alliance with native heathen tribes of Indians. Now that modernity has caught up with them, they pretend to have put behind their foul ways, of polygamy, bigamy and race mixing. We must bring God's wrath down on their heads and punish them for their wickedness."
 america_claim_algonquin: "Claim the Far North"
 america_claim_algonquin_desc: "The uncivilised Algonquian tribes in the Far North have the facade of an industrialised society, but it was only a few centuries ago that they were wasting the land with pastoral nomadism and heathen icon worship. We should show them how things are done in a real country. The Alaskan territories to the North-West are also ours by right."
 america_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 america_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 america_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 america_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 america_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 america_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 america_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 america_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 america_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 america_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 america_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 america_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 america_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 america_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 america_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 america_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 america_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 america_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 america_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 america_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 america_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 america_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 america_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 america_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 america_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 america_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 america_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 america_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 america_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 america_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 america_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 america_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 america_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"

 america_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 america_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 america_deluge_land_management_agency: "Land Management Agency"
 america_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 america_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"
 america_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 america_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 america_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 america_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 america_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 america_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 america_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 america_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 america_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 america_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 america_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 america_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 america_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 america_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 america_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 america_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 america_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 america_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 america_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 america_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 america_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 america_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 america_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 america_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 america_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 america_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 america_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 america_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 america_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 america_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 america_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust.

 japan_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 japan_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 japan_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 japan_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 japan_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 japan_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 japan_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 japan_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."

 japan_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns.

 japan_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 japan_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."

 japan_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 japan_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view.

 japan_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 japan_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 japan_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 japan_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 japan_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 japan_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands.

 japan_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 japan_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 japan_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 japan_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 japan_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 japan_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 japan_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 japan_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 japan_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 japan_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 japan_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 japan_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 japan_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 japan_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 japan_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 japan_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 japan_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 japan_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 japan_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 japan_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 japan_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 turkey_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"

 turkey_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 turkey_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 turkey_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 turkey_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 turkey_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 turkey_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 turkey_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 turkey_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 turkey_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 turkey_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."
 turkey_deluge_individualism: "Individualism"

 turkey_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"
 turkey_deluge_corporatism_desc: "The nation is a machine of many parts. The worker has his place as does the businessman. For the machine to run smoothly, the parts must work together, not waste effort bickering over trivialities."
 turkey_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 turkey_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 turkey_depose_monarch: "Remove the Sultan"
 turkey_depose_monarch_desc: "The Sultan, Mehmed VII, continues to exercise far too much power and influence over our nation. Turkey has a great destiny to seize, and we cannot achieve our dreams with this relic of the past dragging us down. Exile him or send him into the retirement."
 turkey_independent_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"

 turkey_call_to_arms: "Call to Arms"
 turkey_call_to_arms_desc: "Our independent foreign policy is only as effective as the amount of force we can bring to bear on our decisions. We need to expand our faction, and we have the perfect opportunity to do so in the person of Mehmed VII, Caliph of Islam. We will send out a call to arms for all good Islamic rulers to join us in defence of the Caliph."
 turkey_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 turkey_claim_greece_desc: "Greece rebelled from the empire in 1828, and was able to secure independence with British, French and Russian support. The Christian empires are now divided against one another, and we have the opportunity to once again demonstrate that Turkey is the true successor to Byzantium."
 turkey_claim_bulgaria: "Claim Bulgaria"
 turkey_claim_bulgaria_desc: "The Russians helped their slavic cousins to rebel against our just rule in 1875. Bulgaria was even granted more land by France after the Great War. Now, the Europeans are shattered by the rigours of war, while we are once again on the rise, and we can restore order to the rebellious 'kingdom' of Bulgaria."
 turkey_claim_persia: "Claims on Persia"
 turkey_claim_persia_desc: "We have battled the Persian dynasties for centuries over our borders in Iraq and Kurdistan. The Qajar dynasty must be made to recognise Turkey as the pre-eminent power in the Islamic world."
 turkey_claim_caucasia: "Claims on the Caucasus"
 turkey_claim_caucasia_desc: "The Caucasus region exploded into nationalistic revolution during the Great War, and we allowed them to believe they had achieved independence from Russia so that we could divert our attentions elsewhere. Now, with the war ended, we will turn our attentions back to them. Many of the Caucasian peoples are good Muslims who need saving from the heathens and apostates now ruling over them."
 turkey_claim_crimea: "Claim Crimea"
 turkey_claim_crimea_desc: "The Crimean Khanate took half a century for the Russians to conquer. It was not until 1774 that the fortress-ports of Kerch and Yedikale fell. The Osmanli Emperor accepted the loss of the vassal in 1783. Many of the Tatar peoples were then forced out by persecution and warfare. Turkey hosts much of the Tatar diaspora, emigres who would be eager to return to their homeland as conquerers."
 turkey_claim_egypt: "Claim Egypt"
 turkey_claim_egypt_desc: "Egypt was a province of the Ottoman Empire until 1820, when Mamluks rebelled and the army sent to pacify them instead joined them. This 'Khedivate of Egypt' was then absorbed by Britain as a protectorate. After the Great War, the Khedivate was split, with Sudan and the Suez Canal seized by France, while her Spanish ally took Egypt proper. We must recover these strategically vital provinces."

Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 turkey_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 turkey_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 turkey_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 turkey_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 turkey_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 turkey_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 turkey_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 turkey_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 turkey_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 turkey_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 turkey_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 turkey_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 turkey_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 turkey_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 turkey_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 turkey_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 turkey_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 turkey_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 turkey_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 turkey_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 turkey_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 turkey_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 sweden_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 sweden_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 sweden_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 sweden_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 sweden_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 sweden_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 sweden_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 sweden_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 sweden_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 sweden_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 sweden_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 sweden_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 sweden_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 sweden_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 sweden_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 sweden_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 sweden_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"

 sweden_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 sweden_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 sweden_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 sweden_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 sweden_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 sweden_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 sweden_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 sweden_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 sweden_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 sweden_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 sweden_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 sweden_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 sweden_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 sweden_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 sweden_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 sweden_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 sweden_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 sweden_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 sweden_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 sweden_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 sweden_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 sweden_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 sweden_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 sweden_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 sweden_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 sweden_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 sweden_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 sweden_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."

We must rectify that mistake and save the Finns from Russian domination."
 sweden_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 sweden_claim_baltic_desc: "The Swedish Empire owned the Baltics until the 1710s, when the Great Northern War gave Russia the opportunity to seize them. Napoleon carved client duchies from the Russian provinces, but since then the territories have rebelled and become an unruly, anarchic place. We should restore order to these former subjects."

Sweden was pushed out of Pomerania and Mecklenburg by Prussia, later awarded to Westphalia and Poland.

All of these territories are Swedish by right."

 pomerania_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 pomerania_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 pomerania_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 pomerania_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 pomerania_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 pomerania_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 pomerania_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 pomerania_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"

 pomerania_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 pomerania_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 pomerania_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"

 pomerania_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 pomerania_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there.

 pomerania_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 pomerania_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 pomerania_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 pomerania_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 pomerania_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 pomerania_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 louisiana_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 louisiana_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 louisiana_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 louisiana_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 louisiana_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 louisiana_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 louisiana_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 louisiana_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"

 louisiana_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"
 louisiana_deluge_corporatism_desc: "The nation is a machine of many parts. The worker has his place as does the businessman. For the machine to run smoothly, the parts must work together, not waste effort bickering over trivialities."
 louisiana_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 louisiana_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 louisiana_deluge_kkk: "Jim Crow Laws"
 louisiana_deluge_kkk_desc: "The obvious inferiority of the Negro is written plain as day in the Bible, in the natural sciences, and in our observances in everyday life. Why fight against what is natural? We must pass legislation to restrict the rights, movement and speech of national minorities. Local segregation ordinances will serve as our template."
 louisiana_deluge_race_relations: "Equal Protection"
 louisiana_deluge_race_relations_desc: "The freedmen have been abused by kluxers and lynch mobs for too long. We must mete out punishments for lawbreakers even if they have the tacit support of local government and corrupt policemen. The law will not be flaunted and the injustices of racial discrimination will end."
 louisiana_depose_monarch: "Depose the King"
 louisiana_depose_monarch_desc: "King Louis is a relic of the past. His ancestors should never have escaped their flight from the Tuileries. The Bourbons are a spent force and are of no further use to our nation. Let him retire or send him into exile; whatever happens, we need him gone."
 louisiana_aggressive_foreign_policy: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 louisiana_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc: "It is time to secure our own interests abroad, through military force if need be. The times are too tumultuous - we cannot rely on the status quo holding out forever."
 louisiana_claim_quebec: "Reclaim Quebec"
 louisiana_claim_quebec_desc: "The Quebecois had a long history of separatism, rebelling several times until finally succeeding in enforcing their ridiculous claims to sovereignty in negotiations. Make no mistake, they had few military successes: they just made governance prohibitively costly for us. We have learned from our mistakes, and it is time to reclaim the northern provinces."
 louisiana_claim_deseret: "Conquer Deseret"
 louisiana_claim_deseret_desc: "The Bourbon kings in the recent past made several attempts at expanding into the untamed wilderness of the West, but the Mormon heretics mobilised their Indian slaves and carbetbagger Yanqui neighbours to stave off our rightful claims. We have made many advances since those times, and we can finally wipe that evil nation off the map."
 louisiana_claim_mexico: "Seize Texas"
 louisiana_claim_mexico_desc: "The borders with the former Viceroyalty of New Spain, now known as Mexico, were agreed to by mutual discussion in the decades following the Napoleonic wars. However, those years were filled with uncertainty, and with fear of rebellion from the slaves and lower classes. They were hardly fair discussions. We should revisit the border issue with more attention."
 louisiana_claim_algonquin: "Civilise the Algonquian"
 louisiana_claim_algonquin_desc: "The northern wastes are home to tribes of Indians in varying states of nomadism and civility. Aided by the foul Mormons and radical Metis, the Algonquian were able to assert a childish claim of independence in the face of all sense and reason. We must make the attempt once more to civilise the Algonquian by placing them under Louisianan custodianship, for their sake."
 louisiana_claim_america: "Claims on America"
 louisiana_claim_america_desc: "The lands around the Great Lakes had a long history as a Bourbon possession under the kings of France. They were traded for ownership of British colonies in Labrador and Quebec after the Seven Years' War in 1764. We no longer own the Quebec and Labrador colonies, and the British have been supplanted by an American kingdom. We can hardly be expected to abide by such a redundant treaty."
 louisiana_claim_france: "Liberate the Fatherland"
 louisiana_claim_france_desc: "A mere 150 years ago, Radicals overthrew the Bourbons in France and forced the crème of society to flee into exile in Louisiana. The many victims of those dark times cry out for vengeance even today. The Bonaparte dynasty proved itself just as tyrannical, in its own way, as the reign of the bloodthirsty Jacobins. It is time to restore order to the world and return our seat of government to Paris."
 louisiana_claim_spain: "Claims on Spain"
 louisiana_claim_spain_desc: "The Bourbons in Spain ought to have stuck by their French relatives, but they were a fair weather ally and bowed to the Bonapartes at the slightest pressure. We must punish the Spanish for their betrayals and seize their remaining possessions in the Carribean."
 louisiana_capital_to_paris: "Move the Capital to Paris"
 louisiana_capital_to_paris_desc: "We have vanquished the illegitimate usurpers and restored ourselves to the Fatherland in triumph. Now we can integrate the former provinces of France into our nation and go forwards in unity."
 louisiana_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 louisiana_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 louisiana_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 louisiana_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 louisiana_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 louisiana_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 louisiana_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 louisiana_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 louisiana_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 louisiana_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 louisiana_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 louisiana_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 louisiana_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"

 louisiana_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 louisiana_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 louisiana_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 louisiana_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 louisiana_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 louisiana_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 louisiana_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 louisiana_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 louisiana_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 louisiana_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 louisiana_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 louisiana_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 louisiana_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 louisiana_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 louisiana_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 louisiana_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 louisiana_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 louisiana_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 italy_deluge_meritocracy: "Meritocracy"
 italy_deluge_meritocracy_desc: "Our nation needs talented individuals in the bureaucracy and armed forces. The best and brightest should govern."
 italy_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"
 italy_deluge_aristocracy_desc: "Those with a long term interest in the country should rule: families with good breeding and a long history. Commoners would destabilise the realm with their short-sighted demands and rabble rousing."
 italy_deluge_judiciary: "Independent Judiciary"
 italy_deluge_judiciary_desc: "Justice is the very purpose of the state. We must adhere to every letter of every law, and our executive must have oversight from the judiciary to see that this is done."
 italy_deluge_state_terror: "State Terror"
 italy_deluge_state_terror_desc: "We are under threat from within and without. There is no time for indecision, for debate, for trials or juries. We must act in the name of national survival!"
 italy_deluge_popular_sovereignty: "Popular Sovereignty"
 italy_deluge_popular_sovereignty_desc: "The state derives its legitimacy from a popular mandate. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government."
 italy_deluge_divine_right: "Divine Right"
 italy_deluge_divine_right_desc: "The sovereign is appointed by God to fulfil His mandate on Earth. Divine truth cannot be voted on; it cannot be judged in a popularity contest."
 italy_deluge_pluralism: "Pluralism"
 italy_deluge_pluralism_desc: "An open society which considers all viewpoints, no matter how unpopular, is a society which can find the best path to the future."
 italy_deluge_leader_cult: "Leader Cult"
 italy_deluge_leader_cult_desc: "The decadence of the recent upheavals has been put behind us thanks to the guidance of our great Leader. There will be order again."
 italy_deluge_youth_organisations: "Youth Organisations"
 italy_deluge_youth_organisations_desc: "The youth are the future. We will create an organisation to teach them useful skills, like teamwork, initiative, discipline, loyalty and patriotism."
 italy_deluge_land_reform: "Land Reform"
 italy_deluge_land_reform_desc: "The farmers and peasants have struggled to survive on the scraps left for them by the nobility and clergy. Let us redistribute the land and give them hope."
 italy_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 italy_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 italy_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 italy_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 italy_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 italy_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 italy_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 italy_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 italy_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 italy_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."
 italy_deluge_individualism: "Individualism"
 italy_deluge_individualism_desc: "The human spirit is fragile. Demagogues and tyrants would crush it for the sake of their grandiose visions. We cannot allow this."
 italy_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"
 italy_deluge_corporatism_desc: "The nation is a machine of many parts. The worker has his place as does the businessman. For the machine to run smoothly, the parts must work together, not waste effort bickering over trivialities."
 italy_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 italy_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 italy_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 italy_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 italy_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 italy_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 italy_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 italy_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 italy_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 italy_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 italy_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 italy_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 italy_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 italy_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 italy_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 italy_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 italy_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 italy_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 italy_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 italy_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 italy_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 italy_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 italy_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 italy_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 italy_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 italy_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 italy_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 italy_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 italy_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 italy_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 italy_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 italy_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 italy_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 italy_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 italy_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 italy_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.'"
 italy_deluge_war_machine: "War Machine"
 italy_deluge_war_machine_desc: "'Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness, a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilised by the technological singularities of advanced civilisations.'"
 italy_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 italy_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 italy_deluge_land_management_agency: "Land Management Agency"
 italy_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 italy_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"
 italy_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 italy_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 italy_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 italy_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 italy_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 italy_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 italy_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 italy_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 italy_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 italy_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 italy_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 italy_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 italy_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 italy_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 italy_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 italy_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 italy_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 italy_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 italy_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 italy_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 italy_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 italy_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 italy_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 italy_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 italy_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 italy_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 italy_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 italy_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 italy_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 italy_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 italy_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 italy_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 italy_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."

 italy_depose_monarch: "Depose the Monarchy"
 italy_depose_monarch_desc: "The Napoleonic invasions upturned many of the feudal institutions that held back Italian unification, but one institution remains: the monarchy installed by Napoleon to maintain Italy as a puppet. Now is the time for reclaiming sovereignty for the Italian people."
 italy_restore_rome: "The Senate and People"
 italy_restore_rome_desc: "Long ago, our Roman forefathers seized power from the corrupt Tarquinius dynasty and created a republic. After rising in glory through innumerable conquests, the apex of human civilisation was born: the Roman Empire. We will follow their example, in the name of the Senate and People."
 italy_create_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 italy_create_faction_desc: "Italy is once again taking the centre stage of international politics. Our enemies should rightfully fear us, and our allies shall rally to our cause."
 italy_claim_croatia: "Claim Croatia"
 italy_claim_croatia_desc: "The Dalmatian coast has many Italian inhabitants thanks to the trading empire of the Venetians. Even before that, it was a core part of the Roman Empire and therefore a natural component of the new Italy we are building."
 italy_claim_albania: "Claim Albania"
 italy_claim_albania_desc: "Following the Great War, Albania expanded her borders at the expense of our Serbian ally. This was the thanks Albania showed for liberation from the Ottoman menace so many years ago. We should punish Albania. The Adriatic is also vital for Italian trade, and having Albania under our possession would be a good way to defend merchant shipping."
 italy_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 italy_claim_greece_desc: "The Greeks were the first nation in the Balkans to throw off Ottoman rule in the 19th century. While Italy admires Greek courage and tenacity, we also recognise that the Greeks are too weak to stay independent for long. We should save the cradle of European civilisation from the mismanagement of the Greek government."
 italy_claim_ethiopia: "Claim Ethiopia"
 italy_claim_ethiopia_desc: "The Abyssinians are the last truly independent nation in Africa. A Christian nation, they have repeatedly rebuffed attempts at outside influence and managed to unify the disparate principalities and petty kingdoms into one so-called empire. By right of conquest, we will show the Abyssinians what a real empire looks like!"
 italy_claim_austria: "Claims on Austria"
 italy_claim_austria_desc: "In 1928, we declared war on Austria with the intention of seizing South Tyrol and Trieste, regions with Italian majorities in that backwards multi-ethnic empire. Though we failed, the dream lives on. We will issue a demand once again for the return of the Italian regions. With the tumult of the post-war revolutions, Austria is too isolated to resist us."
 italy_claim_france: "Claims on France"
 italy_claim_france_desc: "Savoy, Piedmont and Corsica are all closer linguistically and culturally to Italy than to France. The Kings and Emperors of France seized those lands before Italy was unified, but now our people are strong enough to claim back our birthright. Avanti!"
 italy_claim_malta: "The Fate of Malta"
 italy_claim_malta_desc: "Britain lost her influence in the Mediterranean with the Treaty of Versailles, which stripped her of vast swathes of overseas territory from Egypt to Gibraltar. Malta never fell to the Continental System, however, thanks to a stout defence. Without its former role as a naval base, Malta is nothing but a money sink. We will relieve our former British ally of this burdensome island."

 china_deluge_self-strengthening: "Self-Strengthening"
 china_deluge_self-strengthening_desc: "The original 'self-strengthening movement' of the old Qing government was unable to turn the tide of European imperialism, but it did lay the groundwork for social progress by modernising the bureaucracy, such as the customs agency. We should use the ideological platform we have developed over the last few years to create a social movement in China that will revitalise our nation."

 china_deluge_cultural_reform: "Cultural Reform"
 china_deluge_cultural_reform_desc: "We have defeated the aristocracy ideologically, but many of them continue to hold undue weight in our government and our society. We should strip the useless parasites of their unearned state pensions and root out superstitions and dogmas amongst the peasants."
 china_deluge_turn_outwards: "China Looks Outwards"
 china_deluge_turn_outwards_desc: "We have resolved many of our domestic troubles by enforcing our ideological worldview but the greater challenge remains ahead of us: uniting all China under one banner. The hated Japanese must be pushed back, our rival across the border must be made to capitulate to our rule, and the European empires who interfered with our internal affairs must be shown China is strong once again."
 china_demand_treaty_ports_britain: "Demand Britain's Treaty Ports"
 china_demand_treaty_ports_britain_desc: "The Unequal Treaties were forced on us during times of turmoil and war. The British seized Hong Kong in their Opium War of 1839 as part of their plans to wreck our economy and society. We have fixed the problems they caused, and now the concessions of the old Qing government must be returned."
 china_demand_treaty_ports_france: "Demand France's Treaty Ports"
 china_demand_treaty_ports_france_desc: "The French assisted Qing China during the turmoil following the Opium War in order to oppose British support for Taiping. Still, they demanded their share of concessions when China was weak. Now we are strong. We must have our land back."

 china_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 china_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 china_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 china_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 china_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 china_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 china_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 china_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 china_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 china_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 china_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 china_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 china_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 china_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 china_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"

 china_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 china_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."

 china_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 china_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 china_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 china_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 china_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 china_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 china_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 china_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 china_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 china_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."

 china_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 china_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 china_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 china_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 china_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 china_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 china_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 china_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 china_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 china_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 china_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 china_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 china_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 china_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 china_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 china_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 china_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 china_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 china_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 china_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 china_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 china_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 china_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 china_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 china_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 china_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 china_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 china_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 china_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 china_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 china_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 china_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 china_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 china_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 china_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 china_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 china_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 china_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 china_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 china_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 china_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 china_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 china_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 china_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 china_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 china_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 china_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 china_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 china_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 china_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 china_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 china_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 china_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 china_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 china_deluge_protracted_peoples_war: "Protracted People's War"
 china_deluge_protracted_peoples_war_desc: "With regard to the whole, mobile warfare is primary and guerrilla warfare supplementary; with regard to the parts, guerrilla warfare is primary and mobile warfare supplementary."
 china_deluge_dare_to_die: "Dare To Die"
 china_deluge_dare_to_die_desc: "Where China is lacking in military hardware, we must make do with our audacity and courage. If there are not enough rifles to go around, we will use swords and spears like our forefathers. If we lack anti-tank guns, we shall strap grenades to our bodies and throw ourselves under the tracks. The blood of our martyrs will save the nation!"

 yugoslavia_claim_serbia: "Claim Serbia"
 yugoslavia_claim_serbia_desc: "Serbia seceded from the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century after a series of nationalist rebellions which prompted Russian intervention. Serbia's ambition was to be the pre-eminent power in the Balkans, but this came to naught in the Great War when her participation in the Central Powers resulted in her dismemberment at Versailles."
 yugoslavia_claim_bulgaria: "Claim Bulgaria"
 yugoslavia_claim_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1875 thanks to Russian assistance to nationalist rebels. Much of the turmoil in the region is due to conflicting claims over land between the Slavic and Balkan nations. Bulgaria's tenuous hold on Macedonia is a prime example."
 yugoslavia_claim_albania: "Claim Albania"
 yugoslavia_claim_albania_desc: "Albania is an outlier from the other Balkan nations due to her embrace of Islam during the Ottoman ownership of the region. She achieved territorial expansion at the expense of Serbia following the Great War, which is unlikely to endear her to her neighbours."
 yugoslavia_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 yugoslavia_claim_greece_desc: "Greece was created from the Ottoman Empire in 1828 by a coalition including Britain, France and Russia. This intervention accelerated the decline of the Ottomans, but large Greek populations remain resident in Anatolia and other parts of the Empire."

 yugoslavia_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 yugoslavia_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 yugoslavia_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 yugoslavia_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 yugoslavia_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 yugoslavia_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 yugoslavia_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 yugoslavia_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 yugoslavia_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 yugoslavia_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 yugoslavia_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 yugoslavia_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 yugoslavia_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 yugoslavia_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 yugoslavia_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 yugoslavia_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 yugoslavia_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 yugoslavia_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 yugoslavia_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 yugoslavia_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.'"

 yugoslavia_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 yugoslavia_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."

 yugoslavia_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 yugoslavia_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"
 yugoslavia_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 yugoslavia_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 yugoslavia_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 yugoslavia_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 yugoslavia_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 yugoslavia_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 yugoslavia_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 yugoslavia_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 yugoslavia_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 yugoslavia_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 yugoslavia_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 yugoslavia_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 yugoslavia_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 yugoslavia_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 yugoslavia_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 yugoslavia_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 yugoslavia_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 yugoslavia_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 yugoslavia_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 yugoslavia_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 yugoslavia_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 yugoslavia_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 yugoslavia_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 yugoslavia_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 yugoslavia_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 yugoslavia_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 yugoslavia_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 yugoslavia_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 yugoslavia_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 america_deluge_newunions_desc: "President Ford has realized that he cannot continue to ignore the issue of workers union, beacuse a slong as they remain completely banned, they will join illegal and socilaist ones. Ford, that has always been concerned with the issue of class consciousness and workers' activiteies, has decided to create state-controlled unions, that will in reality bring the workers even more under the corporatist heel. These assemblies could have the unwanted effect of giving workers a place to meet and orgnaize, and socialists could infiltrate them and use them against the state."

The President has set up a plan to increase taxation on American corporations, that won't be completely nationalized but will instead exist in a mixed economic model.

 france_deluge_raise_age: "Every Child"
 france_deluge_raise_age_desc: "The first step in Blum's education reform is an increase of the minimum age to leave school to 14 years.

 france_deluge_fra_wgr_summit_desc: "While our support for the Westphalian government is unquestioned, we may recognize that Frederic II is not the mos compromising monarch...

 france_deluge_armee_air_offensive_desc: "The heavy bombings of the Great War thought us that we cannot be safe until our enemies are defeated. The best doctrine for our airforce would be supporting the army with a strong air support."
 france_deluge_cas_models: "New Bombers"
 france_deluge_cas_models_desc: "We must completely overhaul our airforce, making air support veichles the most important units inside it. In order to do so, we must modernize, expand and empower our models."
 france_deluge_aggressive_airwing: "Grande Armee Coordination"
 france_deluge_aggressive_airwing_desc: "We cannot consider the airforce as an independent part of our armed force, but we must understand that it is simply a piece in the great puzzle of the French armed forces. Indeed it is essential that the Armee de l'Air continues to operate in a close cooperation with the Grande Armee."

 france_deluge_france_natural_borders_desc: "Since before the times of Napoleon many French nationalists argued that the Rhine should be the French borders in the East. Our natural borders must be secured, protected, expanded, even if this means alienating the Germans.

 france_deluge_france_claim_geneve: "The Nice Convention"
 france_deluge_france_claim_geneve_desc: "Switzerland has remained an independent and peaceful nation for most time since the Napoleonic wars; Swiss codardice and refusal to grant us military acces during the Great War testify the artificial nature of their state, and to resolve the Swiss issue once and for all we have sent them an ultimatum demanding a convention to be held in Nice about the future of their nation and Italian, German and French people inside the Federation."

The peninsula has been under French rule for almost a century, and yet it porves to be our most unruly colony, with communist guerrillas costantly hunting down our garrison and the Japanese staring at it with hunger.

 deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"

 deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"

 deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"

 deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"

 deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

His ancestor helped sweep away the old order and then inexplicably chose to replace it with new monarchs and emperors beholden to nothing but their own whims.

 france_league_prohibit_poison_gas_desc: "The Great War proved the horror of poisonous and asphyxiating gases. We should propose a Convention to ban their use."
 france_league_international_court: "International Court of Justice"
 france_league_international_court_desc: "The primary aim of the League of Nations will be to ensure peace. The primary organ through which this aim will be achieved should be a permanent court to arbitrate disputes between members."

 france_league_leave: "Leave the League of Nations"
 france_league_leave_desc: "Perhaps it was too utopian to think we could settle our differences when surrounded by such hateful enemies. We should end our participation in the League of Nations."
 france_punish_britain: "Punish Britain"
 france_punish_britain_desc: "Perfidious Albion is at it again! By attempting to restore their place as the pre-eminent European power, they have sealed their doom. Versailles was too good for them - we must prevent Britain being a threat to us ever again."
 france_punish_poland: "Punish Poland"
 france_punish_poland_desc: "First to fight indeed. The Poles were smashed by French armies in the Great War and almost succumbed to civil unrest. Only our benevolence and mercy left them with as much territory as they still possess. And still they seek to wage war! They have lost the right to independence."
 france_punish_russia: "Punish Russia"
 france_punish_russia_desc: "Ever an expansionist power, the Russians have once again become a threat to the peace of Europe. By securing the independence of the subject nations in Byelorussia, Ukraine, the Baltics and the Caucasus, we thought Russia too weak to attack her neighbours. We were wrong."
 france_punish_japan: "Punish Japan"
 france_punish_japan_desc: "The rising sun in the Far East threatens to overturn the position of the European empires by seizing colonies and annexing neighbours. We must prevent them from becoming too large to handle - we must strike at them now!"
 france_punish_america: "Punish America"
 france_punish_america_desc: "America owes her independence to France, and this is how she repays us? By upsetting the delicate balance of power, the Americans are threatening European, and therefore French, hegemony. Stop them!"
 france_punish_turkey: "Punish Turkey"
 france_punish_turkey_desc: "We saved the Turks from annihilation at the hands of Russia in the Great War. And yet now they seek to expand at the expense of our allies and spherelings. We must put the Turks back in their place."
 france_punish_austria: "Punish Austria"
 france_punish_austria_desc: "The delicate balance of power we established in 1817 is once again under threat, but this time from our Great War ally. The Austrians have been our foes before and suffered for it. We will show them why they should have sought our friendship."
 france_punish_germany: "Punish Germany"
 france_punish_germany_desc: "The Germans were given enormous leeway before the Great War, with their conquest of Swedish Schleswig-Holstein and Wettin Saxony going unpunished by the Emperors. We gave Germany an inch and they have now taken a mile. We have to stop these continued German aggressions for the good of Europe!"
 france_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 france_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 france_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 france_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 france_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 france_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 france_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 france_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 france_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 france_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 france_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 france_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 france_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 france_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 france_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."

 france_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 france_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 france_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 france_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 france_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 france_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 france_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."

 france_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"

 france_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 france_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 france_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 france_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 france_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 france_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 france_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 france_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 france_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 france_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 france_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 france_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 france_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 france_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 france_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 france_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 france_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 france_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 france_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 france_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 france_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 france_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 france_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 france_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 france_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 france_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 france_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 france_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 france_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 france_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 france_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 france_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 france_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 france_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 france_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 france_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 france_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 france_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 france_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 france_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 france_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 france_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 france_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 france_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 france_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 france_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 france_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 france_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 france_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 france_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 france_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 france_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 france_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 france_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 great_britain_deluge_meritocracy: "Meritocracy"
 great_britain_deluge_meritocracy_desc: "Our nation needs talented individuals in the bureaucracy and armed forces. The best and brightest should govern."
 great_britain_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"
 great_britain_deluge_aristocracy_desc: "Those with a long term interest in the country should rule: families with good breeding and a long history. Commoners would destabilise the realm with their short-sighted demands and rabble rousing."
 great_britain_deluge_judiciary: "Independent Judiciary"
 great_britain_deluge_judiciary_desc: "Justice is the very purpose of the state. We must adhere to every letter of every law, and our executive must have oversight from the judiciary to see that this is done."
 great_britain_deluge_state_terror: "State Terror"
 great_britain_deluge_state_terror_desc: "We are under threat from within and without. There is no time for indecision, for debate, for trials or juries. We must act in the name of national survival!"
 great_britain_deluge_popular_sovereignty: "Popular Sovereignty"
 great_britain_deluge_popular_sovereignty_desc: "The state derives its legitimacy from a popular mandate. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government."
 great_britain_deluge_divine_right: "Divine Right"
 great_britain_deluge_divine_right_desc: "The sovereign is appointed by God to fulfil His mandate on Earth. Divine truth cannot be voted on; it cannot be judged in a popularity contest."
 great_britain_deluge_pluralism: "Pluralism"
 great_britain_deluge_pluralism_desc: "An open society which considers all viewpoints, no matter how unpopular, is a society which can find the best path to the future."
 great_britain_deluge_leader_cult: "Leader Cult"
 great_britain_deluge_leader_cult_desc: "The decadence of the recent upheavals has been put behind us thanks to the guidance of our great Leader. There will be order again."
 great_britain_deluge_youth_organisations: "Youth Organisations"
 great_britain_deluge_youth_organisations_desc: "The youth are the future. We will create an organisation to teach them useful skills, like teamwork, initiative, discipline, loyalty and patriotism."
 great_britain_deluge_land_reform: "Land Reform"
 great_britain_deluge_land_reform_desc: "The farmers and peasants have struggled to survive on the scraps left for them by the nobility and clergy. Let us redistribute the land and give them hope."
 great_britain_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 great_britain_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 great_britain_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 great_britain_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 great_britain_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 great_britain_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 great_britain_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 great_britain_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 great_britain_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 great_britain_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."
 great_britain_deluge_individualism: "Individualism"
 great_britain_deluge_individualism_desc: "The human spirit is fragile. Demagogues and tyrants would crush it for the sake of their grandiose visions. We cannot allow this."
 great_britain_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"
 great_britain_deluge_corporatism_desc: "The nation is a machine of many parts. The worker has his place as does the businessman. For the machine to run smoothly, the parts must work together, not waste effort bickering over trivialities."
 great_britain_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 great_britain_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 great_britain_claim_port_africa: "Portuguese Africa"
 great_britain_claim_port_africa_desc: "Portugal was awarded most of the African territory stolen from us at Versailles. We must show the world that the British Empire is still a force to be reckoned with by retaking our imperial possessions."
 great_britain_claim_ireland: "Claim Ireland"
 great_britain_claim_ireland_desc: "The protestants in Ulster cry out for liberation from their Papist oppressors. Though we lost Ireland to French intrigues a century ago, we have never forgotten our duties to the Ulster Orangemen, and we will now fulfil those duties through force of arms."
 great_britain_claim_canada: "Claim Canada"
 great_britain_claim_canada_desc: "Britain agreed to adjust her colonial borders in North America at the conclusion of the Seven Years' War. Bourbon France received the former Canadian territories in exchange for Michigan and Ohio. Since then, the surviving Bourbons in Louisiana have managed to lose 'Quebec' to nationalist separatists. We can use this opportunity to our advantage."
 great_britain_claim_carribean: "Reconquer the Carribean"
 great_britain_claim_carribean_desc: "The Americans seized our Carribean holdings during the Great War, and we were forced to accept their loss at Versailles. Times are changing, and the Americans look weak in their complacency."
 great_britain_befriend_portugal: "Align Portugal"
 great_britain_befriend_portugal_desc: "Our alliance with Portugal was one of the oldest treaties in history, until the Great War shattered all common sense. Bullied by the Spanish and French, the Portuguese were turned against us through no fault of their own. We should offer them a place in the Commonwealth to prevent the French abusing them in the future."
 great_britain_coastal_forts: "Coastal Fortification"
 great_britain_coastal_forts_desc: "The English Channel is a significant obstacle to invasions, and our warships should be our primary defence, but not our only defence. We should build a series of bunkers, pillboxes, barracks and magazines near important landing sites to make conquering our motherland a more difficult prospect."
 great_britain_befriend_spain: "Align Spain"
 great_britain_befriend_spain_desc: "Britain and Spain fought on opposite sides of the Great War, and France rewarded her ally with several pieces of the broken British empire. Ceylon, Egypt and Gibraltar are lost and we need to accept that and move on. We should offer the Spanish an alliance against the French - they will surely be pleased at the prospect of regaining Catalonia."
 great_britain_depose_monarch: "Abolish the Monarchy"
 great_britain_depose_monarch_desc: "The monarchy is an obsolete, feudal institution. The people are the source of the state's legitimacy, and for one family to claim special privileges is an attack on the idea of equality before the law. No more tithe barns, no more droits of the crown, no more duchies: long live the Republic of Great Britain!"
 great_britain_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 russia_deluge_embrace_black_hundreds_desc: "The Black Hundreds are a paramilitary ultranationalist group who seek the revitalisation of the nation.

 russia_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 russia_claim_baltic_desc: "The old Duchy of Courland fell to revolutionists 70 years ago. Virulent republicans with no respect for law and order had the audacity to try to rule themselves, without the stern guidance of their betters. While we attempted to liberate the Baltics from misrule during the Great War, we failed, and the most despicable of Jacobins took the opportunity to seize power. We must undo our recent mistakes."
 russia_claim_byelorussia: "Claim Byelorussia"
 russia_claim_byelorussia_desc: "The territories of White Ruthenia were a particularly outrageous theft on Napoleon I's part. Emperor Alexander II attempted to recover the provinces in 1860, but their meddling neighbours opposed us and won the field. The 'nation' of Byelorussia must be reincorporated into Russia!"
 russia_claim_ukraine: "Claim the Ukraine"
 russia_claim_ukraine_desc: "Of all the former territories of the Russian Empire, the Ukraine is the most distressing for the Russian people to behold. While the various Cossack princes and hetmanates were an acceptable neighour, the recent upheavals of the Great War have resulted in bloodthirsty anarchists seizing power and committing heinous crimes against nature and order. Their continued atrocities must be ended!"
 russia_claim_caucasia: "Claim Caucasia"
 russia_claim_caucasia_desc: "A recent loss, not attributable to Napoleon's bloodlust, the Caucasian provinces rebelled during the Great War, although they had been stirred up by rabblerousers for some time prior. Our armies in the area, sad to say, frequently sided with the rebels rather than restore order. We thank the Saints their betrayal did not cost us all of Russia. Even so, we must put an end to this union of the Caucasian nations."

 russia_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 russia_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 russia_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 russia_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 russia_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 russia_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 russia_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 russia_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 russia_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 russia_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 russia_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 russia_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"

 russia_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 russia_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 russia_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 russia_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 russia_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 russia_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 russia_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 russia_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."

 germany_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"

 germany_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 germany_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."

 germany_claim_holland_desc: "The West Rhineland region around Cologne was stolen from Germany by Napoleon and given to his Dutch puppet state. We do not need to trace the lineage of dynasties to know that this wrong must be righted. We must take back Cologne and punish the Dutch for their complicity."
 germany_claim_france: "Claims on France"
 germany_claim_france_desc: "Long ago, Napoleon's bandit armies swarmed over the Meuse and looted the cultural heartlands of Germany. Bitburg, Kleve, Straßburg, Luxemburg and Trier were oppressed and frenchified. We must push the French back to the Meuse and reclaim our people's history."
 germany_claim_austria: "Claims on Austria"
 germany_claim_austria_desc: "The decrepit Habsburg monarchy was never meant to reach the modern era. It is a relic of the dark ages. All Germans must be united into one nation-state. We will finish what Napoleon started when he disbanded the Holy Roman Empire!"
 germany_claim_poland: "Claims on Poland"
 germany_claim_poland_desc: "Silesia and Prussia were heartlands of the German tribes millenia ago. Though the Slavs expanded into them, the regions still have strong cultural ties with Germany. We must liberate the Germans in Poland from their subjugation."

 germany_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 germany_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 germany_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 germany_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 germany_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 germany_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 germany_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."

 germany_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 germany_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 germany_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 germany_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 germany_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 germany_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 germany_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 germany_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 germany_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 germany_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 germany_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 germany_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 germany_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 germany_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 germany_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 germany_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 germany_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 germany_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 germany_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 germany_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 germany_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 germany_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 germany_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 germany_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 germany_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 germany_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 germany_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 germany_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 germany_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 germany_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 germany_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 germany_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 germany_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 germany_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 germany_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 germany_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 germany_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 germany_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 germany_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 germany_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 germany_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 germany_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 germany_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 germany_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 germany_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 germany_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 germany_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 germany_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 germany_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 germany_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 germany_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 germany_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 germany_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 germany_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 poland_deluge_meritocracy: "Meritocracy"

 poland_abolish_monarchy: "Abolish the Monarchy"
 poland_abolish_monarchy_desc: "Poland does not need a constant reminder of our subjugation to France walking around the halls of power. We should remove Augustus IV's privileges and end the last vestiges of feudalism in our nation."
 poland_form_poland-lithuania: "Form Poland-Lithuania"
 poland_form_poland-lithuania_desc: "A century ago, the ancient union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was destroyed by the treachery of her imperialist neighbours. Napoleon restored some of Poland's autonomy but she never regained her past size. Today we can announce to the world our restoration of Poland's borders to those of the old Commonwealth."
 poland_balkan_diplomacy: "Balkan Diplomacy"
 poland_balkan_diplomacy_desc: "We must go on the diplomatic offensive! We need allies for protection and spreading our influence, so we should try to bring our nearby neighbours to our way of ideological thinking. We can use radio propaganda, newspapers, party donations, and civic organisations."
 poland_befriend_croatia: "Align Croatia"

 poland_befriend_serbia: "Align Serbia"
 poland_befriend_serbia_desc: "The Serbs were our loyal allies in the Great War. They bore much of the brunt of the Treaty of Versailles, being reduced in size to a rump state. With the Serbs by our side, we will have our revenge!"
 poland_befriend_austria: "Align Austria"
 poland_befriend_austria_desc: "The Slavic peoples within the Austrian Empire were the casus bellum for our initiation of hostilities in the Great War, but perhaps the Austrian victory demonstrates the Czech, Slovene and Slovak peoples are better off as constituents of Austria. We should set aside our past differences."

 poland_destroy_bulgaria: "Destroy Bulgaria"
 poland_destroy_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgarian king, who arrogantly styles himself 'Tsar', sided with the French during the Great War. Securing the approaches to Constantinople was a great boon to the Continental System's war efforts. We should punish Bulgaria by inviting our allies to assist in carving her up. The Romanians will also surely want a share of the spoils."
 poland_destroy_romania: "Destroy Romania"
 poland_destroy_romania_desc: "Our Hungarian allies dealt stinging blows to the Romanian kingdom during the Great War, but it was not enough to stave off defeat. Now that the dust has settled, let us finish what we started by dismembering the Romanian state between ourselves and our allies. We can also entice the Bulgarians to assist with the promise of recovering Dobruja."
 poland_claim_czechia: "Claim Czechia"
 poland_claim_czechia_desc: "The decadent fools in Austria have long held our Slavic brothers in bondage. Most were able to escape that moribund embrace during the Napoleonic wars, but the Czechs still languish in feudal servitude. We must liberate all the Western Slavic peoples under the banner of Poland."
 poland_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 poland_claim_baltic_desc: "The Lithuanians were not always members of the Baltic union, nor Russian subjects.

 poland_claim_ukraine: "Claim the Ukraine"

 poland_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 poland_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare.

Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."

 poland_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 poland_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there.

 poland_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 poland_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 poland_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"

 austria_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 austria_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 austria_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 austria_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 austria_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 austria_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."

 austria_appoint_hitler: "Minister-President Adolf Hitler"
 austria_appoint_hitler_desc: "The far-right politician Adolf Hitler has unusual racial beliefs which we disapprove of, but he is a very energetic politician and a good public speaker. We should secure his loyalty by appointing him Minister-President, the Emperor's senior executive official, bringing his supporters into the fold of the establishment and neutering them."
 austria_abolish_monarchy: "Revoke the Imperial Privileges"
 austria_abolish_monarchy_desc: "Otto I's time is up. Whether he goes into exile or retirement, he must cede all his power to the government of Austria. We cannot have a feudal relic ruining our plans."
 austria_claim_croatia: "Claim Croatia"
 austria_claim_croatia_desc: "Croatia was part of the old empire after its nobles chose a Habsburg as their protector in 1527, following wars with Turkey. While the specific lineages of dynasties may be muddied, our role as custodians of civilisation remains clear. Let us assume the role of protector of Croatia once again."
 austria_claim_hungary: "Claim Hungary"
 austria_claim_hungary_desc: "The Crown of Saint Stephen passed to a Habsburg following Turkish assaults on Hungary. The realm remained in union with Austria until they first merged into the Austrian Empire in 1804, and then were split again following the final victory of Napoleon in 1817. Since then, Hungary has gone through periods of instability and warfare, proving themselves unsuited for independence."
 austria_claim_italy: "Claims on Italy"
 austria_claim_italy_desc: "Milan and Naples were annexed into the Habsburg empire at the conclusion of the War of Spanish Succession in 1714. Later, they were separated from Austria by Napoleon, and combined with Venice and the Church states to form the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians claim several regions of Austria even today, so we should strike at them both in pre-emptive self-defence and to right past wrongs."
 austria_claim_poland: "Claims on Poland"
 austria_claim_poland_desc: "Silesia was an Austrian territory until its loss to the now defunct Kingdom of Prussia. Napoleon defeated Prussia and created the puppet kingdoms of Westphalia and Poland, also seizing West Galicia to turn Poland into a large land power. The Great War showed the folly of this, as Poland laid waste to much of Europe. We must reclaim Silesia and West Galicia for European stability."
 austria_independent_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 austria_independent_faction_desc: "Vast lands constituted the former Habsburg realms, which were held in union until the onset of the Napoleonic wars and then merged into the formal Austrian Empire (which our nation is the legal successor to). Those vast lands nowadays lack strong leadership and moral guidance. We can help them achieve good governance once more, by restoring the old borders."
 austria_unify_germany: "Unify Germany"
 austria_unify_germany_desc: "All Germans must be united under one state and one leader. The long history of Germany being divided into many feudal states will finally end, as Austria accepts her destiny as the sovereign state of the German people!"

 austria_greater_austria_desc: "The Hungarian and Austrian peoples enjoyed union within the same state in the past under the Habsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire. With Hungary once again under our benevolent but firm rule, we can integrate their lands into our state by extending the basic privileges of Austrian citizenship to the Hungarian and Croatian peoples."
 austria_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 austria_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 austria_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 austria_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 austria_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 austria_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 austria_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 austria_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 austria_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 austria_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 austria_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 austria_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 austria_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 austria_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 austria_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 austria_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 austria_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 austria_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 austria_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."

We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 austria_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 austria_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 austria_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"

 america_deluge_kkk: "Jim Crow Laws"
 america_deluge_kkk_desc: "The obvious inferiority of the Negro is written plain as day in the Bible, in the natural sciences, and in our observances in everyday life. Why fight against what is natural? We must pass legislation to restrict the rights, movement and speech of national minorities. Local segregation ordinances will serve as our template."
 america_deluge_race_relations: "Equal Protection"
 america_deluge_race_relations_desc: "The freedmen have been abused by kluxers and lynch mobs for too long. We must mete out punishments for lawbreakers even if they have the tacit support of local government and corrupt policemen. The law will not be flaunted and the injustices of racial discrimination will end."

 america_manifest_destiny: "Manifest Destiny"
 america_manifest_destiny_desc: "Providence provided us with the opportunity to spread over the entire continent. We were stymied by rebellion and unable to achieve the greatness we deserved. Now, with the passing of the turbulence of the Great War, the opportunity has arisen once more: the Eagle must spread her wings from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea."
 america_claim_quebec: "Claim Quebec"
 america_claim_quebec_desc: "The rabble-rousing Quebecois rebelled from their former sovereign several decades ago. Since then, things in the Quebec republic went from bad to worse. The radicals who ravaged the nation after the Great War need to be punished for their sins against the natural order."
 america_claim_louisiana: "Claim Louisiana"
 america_claim_louisiana_desc: "The exiled French king was not welcome in his old realm, and he is not welcome in the Americas. The French are an inferior race, and the Louisianans are an especially backwards specimen. They barely understand democracy and constitutionalism. We must liberate them from their ignorance."
 america_claim_deseret: "Claim Deseret"
 america_claim_deseret_desc: "The heretic Mormons to the West fled persecution at our hands and forged an unholy alliance with native heathen tribes of Indians. Now that modernity has caught up with them, they pretend to have put behind their foul ways, of polygamy, bigamy and race mixing. We must bring God's wrath down on their heads and punish them for their wickedness."
 america_claim_algonquin: "Claim the Far North"
 america_claim_algonquin_desc: "The uncivilised Algonquian tribes in the Far North have the facade of an industrialised society, but it was only a few centuries ago that they were wasting the land with pastoral nomadism and heathen icon worship. We should show them how things are done in a real country. The Alaskan territories to the North-West are also ours by right."

 america_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 america_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 america_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 america_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 america_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 america_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 america_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 america_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 america_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 america_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 america_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"

 america_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 america_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 america_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 america_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 america_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 america_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 america_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 america_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 america_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 america_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 america_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."

 america_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 america_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 america_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 america_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 america_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 america_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 america_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 america_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 america_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 america_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 america_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 america_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 america_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 america_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 america_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 america_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 america_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 america_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 america_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 america_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 america_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 america_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 america_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 america_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 america_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 america_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 america_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 america_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 america_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 america_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 america_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 america_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 america_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 america_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 america_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 america_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 america_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 america_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 america_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 america_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 america_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 america_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."

 japan_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 japan_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics.

 japan_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view.

 japan_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 japan_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 japan_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"

 japan_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 japan_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment.

 japan_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 japan_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."

 japan_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 japan_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 japan_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"

 japan_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 japan_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 japan_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 japan_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 japan_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"

 japan_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 japan_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 turkey_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 turkey_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 turkey_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 turkey_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 turkey_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 turkey_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 turkey_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"

 turkey_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"

 turkey_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 turkey_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 turkey_depose_monarch: "Remove the Sultan"
 turkey_depose_monarch_desc: "The Sultan, Mehmed VII, continues to exercise far too much power and influence over our nation. Turkey has a great destiny to seize, and we cannot achieve our dreams with this relic of the past dragging us down. Exile him or send him into the retirement."
 turkey_independent_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"

 turkey_call_to_arms: "Call to Arms"
 turkey_call_to_arms_desc: "Our independent foreign policy is only as effective as the amount of force we can bring to bear on our decisions. We need to expand our faction, and we have the perfect opportunity to do so in the person of Mehmed VII, Caliph of Islam. We will send out a call to arms for all good Islamic rulers to join us in defence of the Caliph."
 turkey_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 turkey_claim_greece_desc: "Greece rebelled from the empire in 1828, and was able to secure independence with British, French and Russian support. The Christian empires are now divided against one another, and we have the opportunity to once again demonstrate that Turkey is the true successor to Byzantium."
 turkey_claim_bulgaria: "Claim Bulgaria"
 turkey_claim_bulgaria_desc: "The Russians helped their slavic cousins to rebel against our just rule in 1875. Bulgaria was even granted more land by France after the Great War. Now, the Europeans are shattered by the rigours of war, while we are once again on the rise, and we can restore order to the rebellious 'kingdom' of Bulgaria."
 turkey_claim_persia: "Claims on Persia"
 turkey_claim_persia_desc: "We have battled the Persian dynasties for centuries over our borders in Iraq and Kurdistan. The Qajar dynasty must be made to recognise Turkey as the pre-eminent power in the Islamic world."
 turkey_claim_caucasia: "Claims on the Caucasus"
 turkey_claim_caucasia_desc: "The Caucasus region exploded into nationalistic revolution during the Great War, and we allowed them to believe they had achieved independence from Russia so that we could divert our attentions elsewhere. Now, with the war ended, we will turn our attentions back to them. Many of the Caucasian peoples are good Muslims who need saving from the heathens and apostates now ruling over them."
 turkey_claim_crimea: "Claim Crimea"
 turkey_claim_crimea_desc: "The Crimean Khanate took half a century for the Russians to conquer. It was not until 1774 that the fortress-ports of Kerch and Yedikale fell. The Osmanli Emperor accepted the loss of the vassal in 1783. Many of the Tatar peoples were then forced out by persecution and warfare. Turkey hosts much of the Tatar diaspora, emigres who would be eager to return to their homeland as conquerers."
 turkey_claim_egypt: "Claim Egypt"
 turkey_claim_egypt_desc: "Egypt was a province of the Ottoman Empire until 1820, when Mamluks rebelled and the army sent to pacify them instead joined them. This 'Khedivate of Egypt' was then absorbed by Britain as a protectorate. After the Great War, the Khedivate was split, with Sudan and the Suez Canal seized by France, while her Spanish ally took Egypt proper. We must recover these strategically vital provinces."
 turkey_deluge_architects: "Architects"

 turkey_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 turkey_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 turkey_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 turkey_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 turkey_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 turkey_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 turkey_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 turkey_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 turkey_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 turkey_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 turkey_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 turkey_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"

 turkey_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 turkey_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 turkey_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 turkey_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 turkey_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 turkey_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 turkey_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 turkey_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

 sweden_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 sweden_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 sweden_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 sweden_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 sweden_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 sweden_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."

We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."

 sweden_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 sweden_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 sweden_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 sweden_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 sweden_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 sweden_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 sweden_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 sweden_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 sweden_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 sweden_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 sweden_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 sweden_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 sweden_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 sweden_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 sweden_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 sweden_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 sweden_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 sweden_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 sweden_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 sweden_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 sweden_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 sweden_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 sweden_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 sweden_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 sweden_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 sweden_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 sweden_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 sweden_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 sweden_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 sweden_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 sweden_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 sweden_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 sweden_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 sweden_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."

 sweden_claim_finland: "Claim Finland"
 sweden_claim_finland_desc: "Russia was a key player, and for some time a benefactor, in the numerous alliances and betrayals of the Napoleonic wars. Finland was lost at a time when Russia and France were allied. After Napoleon's final victory, Finland was not returned to us. We must rectify that mistake and save the Finns from Russian domination."
 sweden_claim_baltic: "Claim the Baltic States"
 sweden_claim_baltic_desc: "The Swedish Empire owned the Baltics until the 1710s, when the Great Northern War gave Russia the opportunity to seize them. Napoleon carved client duchies from the Russian provinces, but since then the territories have rebelled and become an unruly, anarchic place. We should restore order to these former subjects."
 sweden_claim_north_germany: "Claim Northern Germany"
 sweden_claim_north_germany_desc: "Denmark took Stade in the Great Northern war, later losing it to Napoleon. Sweden was pushed out of Pomerania and Mecklenburg by Prussia, later awarded to Westphalia and Poland. Sweden became isolated enough from the rest of the Continental System for Westphalia to attack and seize the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in the 1890s. All of these territories are Swedish by right."
 sweden_claim_britain: "Claim Britain"
 sweden_claim_britain_desc: "Great Britain is a powerful island nation, although she has been on the decline for the last hundred years. Never able to shake off French dominance of Europe following the Napoleonic wars, Britain lost many colonies during the recent Great War. Still, her powerful navy threatens Swedish sovereignty. We should pre-emptively destroy the threat Britain poses by adding England and Scotland to our union."

 louisiana_deluge_kkk_desc: "The obvious inferiority of the Negro is written plain as day in the Bible, in the natural sciences, and in our observances in everyday life. Why fight against what is natural? We must pass legislation to restrict the rights, movement and speech of national minorities. Local segregation ordinances will serve as our template."
 louisiana_deluge_race_relations: "Equal Protection"
 louisiana_deluge_race_relations_desc: "The freedmen have been abused by kluxers and lynch mobs for too long.

The law will not be flaunted and the injustices of racial discrimination will end."
 louisiana_depose_monarch: "Depose the King"
 louisiana_depose_monarch_desc: "King Louis is a relic of the past. His ancestors should never have escaped their flight from the Tuileries. The Bourbons are a spent force and are of no further use to our nation. Let him retire or send him into exile; whatever happens, we need him gone."

 louisiana_claim_quebec: "Reclaim Quebec"
 louisiana_claim_quebec_desc: "The Quebecois had a long history of separatism, rebelling several times until finally succeeding in enforcing their ridiculous claims to sovereignty in negotiations. Make no mistake, they had few military successes: they just made governance prohibitively costly for us. We have learned from our mistakes, and it is time to reclaim the northern provinces."
 louisiana_claim_deseret: "Conquer Deseret"
 louisiana_claim_deseret_desc: "The Bourbon kings in the recent past made several attempts at expanding into the untamed wilderness of the West, but the Mormon heretics mobilised their Indian slaves and carbetbagger Yanqui neighbours to stave off our rightful claims. We have made many advances since those times, and we can finally wipe that evil nation off the map."
 louisiana_claim_mexico: "Seize Texas"
 louisiana_claim_mexico_desc: "The borders with the former Viceroyalty of New Spain, now known as Mexico, were agreed to by mutual discussion in the decades following the Napoleonic wars. However, those years were filled with uncertainty, and with fear of rebellion from the slaves and lower classes. They were hardly fair discussions. We should revisit the border issue with more attention."
 louisiana_claim_algonquin: "Civilise the Algonquian"
 louisiana_claim_algonquin_desc: "The northern wastes are home to tribes of Indians in varying states of nomadism and civility. Aided by the foul Mormons and radical Metis, the Algonquian were able to assert a childish claim of independence in the face of all sense and reason. We must make the attempt once more to civilise the Algonquian by placing them under Louisianan custodianship, for their sake."
 louisiana_claim_america: "Claims on America"
 louisiana_claim_america_desc: "The lands around the Great Lakes had a long history as a Bourbon possession under the kings of France. They were traded for ownership of British colonies in Labrador and Quebec after the Seven Years' War in 1764. We no longer own the Quebec and Labrador colonies, and the British have been supplanted by an American kingdom. We can hardly be expected to abide by such a redundant treaty."
 louisiana_claim_france: "Liberate the Fatherland"
 louisiana_claim_france_desc: "A mere 150 years ago, Radicals overthrew the Bourbons in France and forced the crème of society to flee into exile in Louisiana. The many victims of those dark times cry out for vengeance even today. The Bonaparte dynasty proved itself just as tyrannical, in its own way, as the reign of the bloodthirsty Jacobins. It is time to restore order to the world and return our seat of government to Paris."
 louisiana_claim_spain: "Claims on Spain"
 louisiana_claim_spain_desc: "The Bourbons in Spain ought to have stuck by their French relatives, but they were a fair weather ally and bowed to the Bonapartes at the slightest pressure. We must punish the Spanish for their betrayals and seize their remaining possessions in the Carribean."
 louisiana_capital_to_paris: "Move the Capital to Paris"
 louisiana_capital_to_paris_desc: "We have vanquished the illegitimate usurpers and restored ourselves to the Fatherland in triumph. Now we can integrate the former provinces of France into our nation and go forwards in unity."
 louisiana_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 louisiana_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 louisiana_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 louisiana_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 louisiana_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 louisiana_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 louisiana_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 louisiana_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 louisiana_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 louisiana_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 louisiana_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 louisiana_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 louisiana_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 louisiana_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 louisiana_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 louisiana_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 louisiana_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 louisiana_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 louisiana_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 louisiana_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 louisiana_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 louisiana_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 louisiana_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 louisiana_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 louisiana_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 louisiana_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 louisiana_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 louisiana_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 louisiana_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."

 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 louisiana_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 louisiana_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 louisiana_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 louisiana_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 louisiana_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 italy_deluge_meritocracy: "Meritocracy"
 italy_deluge_meritocracy_desc: "Our nation needs talented individuals in the bureaucracy and armed forces. The best and brightest should govern."
 italy_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"
 italy_deluge_aristocracy_desc: "Those with a long term interest in the country should rule: families with good breeding and a long history. Commoners would destabilise the realm with their short-sighted demands and rabble rousing."
 italy_deluge_judiciary: "Independent Judiciary"
 italy_deluge_judiciary_desc: "Justice is the very purpose of the state. We must adhere to every letter of every law, and our executive must have oversight from the judiciary to see that this is done."
 italy_deluge_state_terror: "State Terror"
 italy_deluge_state_terror_desc: "We are under threat from within and without. There is no time for indecision, for debate, for trials or juries. We must act in the name of national survival!"
 italy_deluge_popular_sovereignty: "Popular Sovereignty"
 italy_deluge_popular_sovereignty_desc: "The state derives its legitimacy from a popular mandate. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government."
 italy_deluge_divine_right: "Divine Right"
 italy_deluge_divine_right_desc: "The sovereign is appointed by God to fulfil His mandate on Earth. Divine truth cannot be voted on; it cannot be judged in a popularity contest."
 italy_deluge_pluralism: "Pluralism"
 italy_deluge_pluralism_desc: "An open society which considers all viewpoints, no matter how unpopular, is a society which can find the best path to the future."
 italy_deluge_leader_cult: "Leader Cult"
 italy_deluge_leader_cult_desc: "The decadence of the recent upheavals has been put behind us thanks to the guidance of our great Leader. There will be order again."
 italy_deluge_youth_organisations: "Youth Organisations"
 italy_deluge_youth_organisations_desc: "The youth are the future. We will create an organisation to teach them useful skills, like teamwork, initiative, discipline, loyalty and patriotism."
 italy_deluge_land_reform: "Land Reform"
 italy_deluge_land_reform_desc: "The farmers and peasants have struggled to survive on the scraps left for them by the nobility and clergy. Let us redistribute the land and give them hope."
 italy_deluge_manorialism: "Manorialism"
 italy_deluge_manorialism_desc: "The beauty of the countryside is a refuge for the soul of our nation, battered by modernity and the encroachment of the cities. Protect the stately homes, the honest yeomenry, and the great estates."
 italy_deluge_police_consent: "Policing By Consent"
 italy_deluge_police_consent_desc: "The state is a blunt instrument, a bludgeon that can do terrible damage if it is wielded maliciously. State violence must be accountable and transparent to prevent abuses."
 italy_deluge_secret_police: "Secret Police"
 italy_deluge_secret_police_desc: "The state has many enemies that hide themselves from public view, only revealing their machinations to fellow plotters and schemers. We must track these dissidents using any means necessary to ensure national security."
 italy_deluge_fraternal_nations: "Fraternal Nations"
 italy_deluge_fraternal_nations_desc: "Ordinary people the world over are united by basic common interests. The parasitic elites of the world band together to suppress the people, so the people must likewise band together to protect themselves from the elites."
 italy_deluge_dynastic_politics: "Dynastic Politics"
 italy_deluge_dynastic_politics_desc: "Just as marriage and the family are the foundations of civil society, they should also be the basis for world peace and international cooperation."
 italy_deluge_individualism: "Individualism"
 italy_deluge_individualism_desc: "The human spirit is fragile. Demagogues and tyrants would crush it for the sake of their grandiose visions. We cannot allow this."
 italy_deluge_corporatism: "Corporatism"
 italy_deluge_corporatism_desc: "The nation is a machine of many parts. The worker has his place as does the businessman. For the machine to run smoothly, the parts must work together, not waste effort bickering over trivialities."
 italy_deluge_national_unity: "National Unity"
 italy_deluge_national_unity_desc: "Our purpose has been made clear and we have rallied the hesitant and silenced the critics, but we must demonstrate our purpose to the populace."
 italy_deluge_architects: "Architects"
 italy_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 italy_deluge_production_lines: "Production Lines"
 italy_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 italy_deluge_time_and_motion: "Time & Motion Studies"
 italy_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 italy_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Synthetic Oils"
 italy_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 italy_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Resource Efficiency"
 italy_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 italy_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 italy_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 italy_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 italy_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 italy_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 italy_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 italy_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 italy_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 italy_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 italy_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 italy_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 italy_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 italy_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 italy_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 italy_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 italy_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 italy_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 italy_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 italy_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 italy_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 italy_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 italy_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 italy_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
 italy_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.'"
 italy_deluge_war_machine: "War Machine"
 italy_deluge_war_machine_desc: "'Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness, a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilised by the technological singularities of advanced civilisations.'"
 italy_deluge_production_management_agency: "Production Management Agency"
 italy_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 italy_deluge_land_management_agency: "Land Management Agency"
 italy_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 italy_deluge_public_works_agency: "Public Works Agency"
 italy_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 italy_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 italy_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 italy_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Naval Infrastructure"
 italy_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 italy_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 italy_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 italy_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 italy_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 italy_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 italy_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 italy_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 italy_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 italy_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 italy_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 italy_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 italy_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 italy_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 italy_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 italy_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 italy_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 italy_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 italy_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 italy_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 italy_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 italy_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 italy_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 italy_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 italy_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 italy_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 italy_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 italy_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 italy_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 italy_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 italy_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 italy_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 italy_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 italy_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 italy_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 italy_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 italy_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 italy_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 italy_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 italy_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 italy_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 italy_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 italy_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 italy_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 italy_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 italy_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"

 italy_depose_monarch: "Depose the Monarchy"
 italy_depose_monarch_desc: "The Napoleonic invasions upturned many of the feudal institutions that held back Italian unification, but one institution remains: the monarchy installed by Napoleon to maintain Italy as a puppet. Now is the time for reclaiming sovereignty for the Italian people."
 italy_restore_rome: "The Senate and People"
 italy_restore_rome_desc: "Long ago, our Roman forefathers seized power from the corrupt Tarquinius dynasty and created a republic. After rising in glory through innumerable conquests, the apex of human civilisation was born: the Roman Empire. We will follow their example, in the name of the Senate and People."
 italy_create_faction: "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 italy_create_faction_desc: "Italy is once again taking the centre stage of international politics. Our enemies should rightfully fear us, and our allies shall rally to our cause."
 italy_claim_croatia: "Claim Croatia"
 italy_claim_croatia_desc: "The Dalmatian coast has many Italian inhabitants thanks to the trading empire of the Venetians. Even before that, it was a core part of the Roman Empire and therefore a natural component of the new Italy we are building."
 italy_claim_albania: "Claim Albania"
 italy_claim_albania_desc: "Following the Great War, Albania expanded her borders at the expense of our Serbian ally. This was the thanks Albania showed for liberation from the Ottoman menace so many years ago. We should punish Albania. The Adriatic is also vital for Italian trade, and having Albania under our possession would be a good way to defend merchant shipping."
 italy_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 italy_claim_greece_desc: "The Greeks were the first nation in the Balkans to throw off Ottoman rule in the 19th century. While Italy admires Greek courage and tenacity, we also recognise that the Greeks are too weak to stay independent for long. We should save the cradle of European civilisation from the mismanagement of the Greek government."
 italy_claim_ethiopia: "Claim Ethiopia"
 italy_claim_ethiopia_desc: "The Abyssinians are the last truly independent nation in Africa. A Christian nation, they have repeatedly rebuffed attempts at outside influence and managed to unify the disparate principalities and petty kingdoms into one so-called empire. By right of conquest, we will show the Abyssinians what a real empire looks like!"
 italy_claim_austria: "Claims on Austria"
 italy_claim_austria_desc: "In 1928, we declared war on Austria with the intention of seizing South Tyrol and Trieste, regions with Italian majorities in that backwards multi-ethnic empire. Though we failed, the dream lives on. We will issue a demand once again for the return of the Italian regions. With the tumult of the post-war revolutions, Austria is too isolated to resist us."
 italy_claim_france: "Claims on France"
 italy_claim_france_desc: "Savoy, Piedmont and Corsica are all closer linguistically and culturally to Italy than to France. The Kings and Emperors of France seized those lands before Italy was unified, but now our people are strong enough to claim back our birthright. Avanti!"
 italy_claim_malta: "The Fate of Malta"
 italy_claim_malta_desc: "Britain lost her influence in the Mediterranean with the Treaty of Versailles, which stripped her of vast swathes of overseas territory from Egypt to Gibraltar. Malta never fell to the Continental System, however, thanks to a stout defence. Without its former role as a naval base, Malta is nothing but a money sink. We will relieve our former British ally of this burdensome island."

 china_deluge_self-strengthening: "Self-Strengthening"
 china_deluge_self-strengthening_desc: "The original 'self-strengthening movement' of the old Qing government was unable to turn the tide of European imperialism, but it did lay the groundwork for social progress by modernising the bureaucracy, such as the customs agency. We should use the ideological platform we have developed over the last few years to create a social movement in China that will revitalise our nation."
 china_deluge_cultural_revolution: "Cultural Revolution"

 china_deluge_cultural_reform: "Cultural Reform"
 china_deluge_cultural_reform_desc: "We have defeated the aristocracy ideologically, but many of them continue to hold undue weight in our government and our society. We should strip the useless parasites of their unearned state pensions and root out superstitions and dogmas amongst the peasants."
 china_deluge_turn_outwards: "China Looks Outwards"
 china_deluge_turn_outwards_desc: "We have resolved many of our domestic troubles by enforcing our ideological worldview but the greater challenge remains ahead of us: uniting all China under one banner. The hated Japanese must be pushed back, our rival across the border must be made to capitulate to our rule, and the European empires who interfered with our internal affairs must be shown China is strong once again."
 china_demand_treaty_ports_britain: "Demand Britain's Treaty Ports"
 china_demand_treaty_ports_britain_desc: "The Unequal Treaties were forced on us during times of turmoil and war. The British seized Hong Kong in their Opium War of 1839 as part of their plans to wreck our economy and society. We have fixed the problems they caused, and now the concessions of the old Qing government must be returned."
 china_demand_treaty_ports_france: "Demand France's Treaty Ports"
 china_demand_treaty_ports_france_desc: "The French assisted Qing China during the turmoil following the Opium War in order to oppose British support for Taiping. Still, they demanded their share of concessions when China was weak. Now we are strong. We must have our land back."
 china_claim_tibet: "Claim Tibet"

 china_demand_treaty_ports_portugal_desc: "Macau was granted to Portugal as the gateway for European trade into China in 1557. It was never intended to be an outpost of foreign sovereignty, only a means to enrich the Ming dynasty. The Portuguese have overstepped their bounds and must return Macau."
 china_deluge_war_with_rival: "There Cannot Be Two Skies"
 china_deluge_war_with_rival_desc: "The division of China into two states is an utterly intolerable situation which cannot last much longer.

 china_deluge_develop_steel: "Develop Steel Industry"
 china_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 china_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Advanced Alloys"
 china_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for drills, lathes and armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 china_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Fossil Fuels"
 china_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 china_deluge_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"

 china_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 china_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 china_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 china_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 china_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"

 china_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Defence Research Agency"
 china_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."

 china_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 china_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 china_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 china_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 china_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 china_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 china_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 china_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 china_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 china_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 china_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 china_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 china_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 china_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 china_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 china_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 china_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 china_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 china_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 china_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 china_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 china_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 china_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 china_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 china_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 china_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 china_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 china_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 china_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 china_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 china_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 china_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 china_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 china_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 china_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 china_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 china_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 china_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 china_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 china_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 china_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 china_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 china_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 china_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 china_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 china_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 china_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 china_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 china_deluge_protracted_peoples_war: "Protracted People's War"
 china_deluge_protracted_peoples_war_desc: "With regard to the whole, mobile warfare is primary and guerrilla warfare supplementary; with regard to the parts, guerrilla warfare is primary and mobile warfare supplementary."
 china_deluge_dare_to_die: "Dare To Die"
 china_deluge_dare_to_die_desc: "Where China is lacking in military hardware, we must make do with our audacity and courage. If there are not enough rifles to go around, we will use swords and spears like our forefathers. If we lack anti-tank guns, we shall strap grenades to our bodies and throw ourselves under the tracks. The blood of our martyrs will save the nation!"

 yugoslavia_deluge_aristocracy: "Aristocracy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_aristocracy_desc: "Those with a long term interest in the country should rule: families with good breeding and a long history. Commoners would destabilise the realm with their short-sighted demands and rabble rousing."
 yugoslavia_deluge_judiciary: "Independent Judiciary"

 yugoslavia_claim_serbia: "Claim Serbia"
 yugoslavia_claim_serbia_desc: "Serbia seceded from the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century after a series of nationalist rebellions which prompted Russian intervention. Serbia's ambition was to be the pre-eminent power in the Balkans, but this came to naught in the Great War when her participation in the Central Powers resulted in her dismemberment at Versailles."
 yugoslavia_claim_bulgaria: "Claim Bulgaria"
 yugoslavia_claim_bulgaria_desc: "Bulgaria achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1875 thanks to Russian assistance to nationalist rebels. Much of the turmoil in the region is due to conflicting claims over land between the Slavic and Balkan nations. Bulgaria's tenuous hold on Macedonia is a prime example."
 yugoslavia_claim_albania: "Claim Albania"
 yugoslavia_claim_albania_desc: "Albania is an outlier from the other Balkan nations due to her embrace of Islam during the Ottoman ownership of the region. She achieved territorial expansion at the expense of Serbia following the Great War, which is unlikely to endear her to her neighbours."
 yugoslavia_claim_greece: "Claim Greece"
 yugoslavia_claim_greece_desc: "Greece was created from the Ottoman Empire in 1828 by a coalition including Britain, France and Russia. This intervention accelerated the decline of the Ottomans, but large Greek populations remain resident in Anatolia and other parts of the Empire."

 yugoslavia_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 yugoslavia_deluge_civilian_industry: "Subsidise Civilian Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industry: "Expand Military Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 yugoslavia_deluge_more_industry: "Public Works Programme"
 yugoslavia_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_research: "Electronics Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 yugoslavia_deluge_radar_research: "Electromagnetics Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 yugoslavia_deluge_encryption_research: "Encryption Research"
 yugoslavia_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_industry: "Electronics Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 yugoslavia_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"

 yugoslavia_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."

 yugoslavia_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."

 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_expansion: "Naval Expansion"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_ship_roles: "New Ship Roles"
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_academy: "Naval Academy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 yugoslavia_deluge_innovative_navy: "Innovative Navy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_traditional_navy: "Traditional Navy"
 yugoslavia_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_exercises: "Naval Exercises"
 yugoslavia_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Lessons of the Great War"
 yugoslavia_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_weapon_advances: "Weapon Advances"
 yugoslavia_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 yugoslavia_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Nation-at-Arms"
 yugoslavia_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 yugoslavia_deluge_standing_army: "Standing Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army.

 yugoslavia_deluge_artillery_advances: "Artillery Advances"
 yugoslavia_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 yugoslavia_deluge_offensive_army: "Offensive Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 yugoslavia_deluge_defensive_army: "Defensive Army"
 yugoslavia_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 yugoslavia_deluge_support_brigades: "Support Brigades"
 yugoslavia_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands.

 yugoslavia_deluge_new_training_regimes: "New Training Regimes"
 yugoslavia_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 yugoslavia_deluge_specialist_roles: "Specialist Roles"
 yugoslavia_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 yugoslavia_deluge_marines: "Marines & Naval Infantry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 yugoslavia_deluge_paratroopers: "Parachute & Airlanding Units"
 yugoslavia_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 yugoslavia_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Mobile Warfare"
 yugoslavia_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 yugoslavia_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Armoured Warfare"
 yugoslavia_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 yugoslavia_deluge_field_exercises: "Field Exercises"
 yugoslavia_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Aircraft Industry"
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Aircraft Materials"
 yugoslavia_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 yugoslavia_deluge_army_airforce: "Autonomous Airforce"
 yugoslavia_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 yugoslavia_deluge_flight_schools: "Flight Schools"
 yugoslavia_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."

Ford, that has always been concerned with the issue of class consciousness and workers' activiteies, has decided to create state-controlled unions, that will in reality bring the workers even more under the corporatist heel.

 france_deluge_raise_age: "Every Child"
 france_deluge_raise_age_desc: "The first step in Blum's education reform is an increase of the minimum age to leave school to 14 years.

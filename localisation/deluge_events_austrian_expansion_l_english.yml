[From.GetAdjective] propaganda claims that the lands of the 'Crown of Saint Stephen' are integral parts of the Austrian sphere. The [From.GetAdjective] army is believed to be fully mobilised to press the claim by force."

 austrian_expansion3title: "Austrian Claims on Italy"
 austrian_expansion3desc: "Government figures in [From.GetNameDef] have for some time been propagandising about the 'return' of Milan and Naples to the Austrian sphere of influence.

The incredible demand seems to be the culmination of months of propaganda in [From.GetNameDef] which promoted the ideals of German nationalism and a final conclusion to the long history of Germans being divided into many feudal states."

 austrian_expansion6title: "Austria Forms Danubian Union"
 austrian_expansion6desc: "The Jacobin regime in Austria has unified the various Central European nations it controls into a single state, with Hungarian and Croatian peoples being granted citizenship and receiving the same rights and obligations as Austrians. [From.GetNameDefCap] justifies its legitimacy upon the three hundred year history of Hungary and Austria being in personal union under the Habsburgs. This union was characterised by the subservience of Hungary to Austrian needs, and many people question whether the distant leadership in Vienna will be any more responsive than the recently deposed monarchs.

 austrian_expansion8desc: "The old Austro-Hungarian state has been reborn after almost a hundred years of separation. [From.GetNameDefCap] justifies its legitimacy upon the three hundred year history of Hungary and Austria being in personal union under the Habsburgs.

 austrian_expansion10desc: "For some time, our Minister-President has been gathering more support from the armed forces and state bureaucracy.

 austrian_expansion12title: "Hitler's Failed Putsch"
 austrian_expansion12desc: "The ultranationalist government of [From.GetNameDef] has seen an attempted palace coup, defeated at the last moment by troops loyal to Engelbert Dollfuss. Adolf Hitler's paramilitaries engaged in roving gun battles on the streets of the capital but lacked the firepower of the state forces. The former Minister-President now resides in a shallow grave somewhere near Vienna, and a purge of suspected National Socialists is taking place within the Fatherland Front."

 austrian_expansion13title: "[From.GetLeader] Unifies Germany"
 austrian_expansion13desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has been formally inaugurated at a parade in Berlin amidst much fanfare and celebration. The socialist state has achieved a long-held dream of the German people, with Austria and the former Westphalian lands united into a single republic. The German Question has been answered with the 'Großdeutsche Lösung', the 'Greater German Solution'. While the Westphalian monarchy had seized most of the German-speaking territories, those remaining under the control of France and her sphere of influence were a source of great frustration to German nationalists.

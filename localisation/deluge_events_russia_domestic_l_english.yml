 russia_domestic1title: "Rebellious Officers"
 russia_domestic1desc: "We have finally removed the evil Black Monk from power. The civil servants he installed are gone, the ministers he had appointed have been forced to resign, and a successful propaganda campaign is underway to persuade the peasantry of his baleful influence. However, his tendrils were long and dug deep into our state, and many of the noble officers who lead our forces remain loyal to Rasputin.\n\nThey are seeking 'clarification' as to their status in light of the many changes to national policy we are implementing. They demand assurance that their positions will not be threatened."
 russia_domestic1opta: "You fought bravely in the Great War, we need you."
 russia_domestic1optb: "You have no place in the new Russia."
 russia_domestic2title: "Officers Resign"
 russia_domestic2desc: "We have finally removed the evil Black Monk from power. The struggle has been long, but we have transformed Russia, its culture, its institutions and its political system. Rasputin's influence has been dying for some time, but we have torn the roots out and ensured the dark weed will never regrow.\n\nToo late, the incompetent officers Rasputin promoted have realised what is happening and are now trying to undo our good work. With the corrupt patronage system mostly dismantled and their network of supporters severely diminished, the marshals have little recourse left but to threaten to resign."
 russia_domestic2opta: "We regretfully accept your resignations."
 russia_domestic2optb: "Good riddance, fools. Take your cronies with you."
 russia_domestic3title: "Military Coup"
 russia_domestic3desc: "The reactionary order is trying to fight back against our advance towards socialism! The old officer corps, composed of both cowardly Rasputin boot-lickers and opportunistic ultranationalists, are mobilising the right-wing into a so-called 'Free Officers Movement' which will oppose our reforms through force of arms!\n\nAfter we have crushed this rebellion, the officer corps will have to be rebuilt from scratch, with well-trained and intelligent commanders who are dedicated to the cause of the revolution."
 russia_domestic3opt: "We will bury you!"
 russia_domestic4title: "Ultranationalist Rivalries"
 russia_domestic4desc: "Rasputin and Vostorgov have become fierce rivals since the two began competing at court. The Black Hundredist has finally outmaneuvered the Black Monk, implicating him in a corruption scandal which has been leaked to the press.\n\nAlthough Rasputin has deep connexions in the state, Vostorgov would be able to counter these with his own patronage system if we chose to side with him and demand Rasputin's exile."
 russia_domestic4opta: "Get rid of this corrupting influence!"
 russia_domestic4optb: "Stop bickering, we have other concerns."

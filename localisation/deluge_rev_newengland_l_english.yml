  america_deluge_the_bonus_army_desc: "With the civil war raging, we need all possible help. MacArthur led the so called "bonus army", a group of veterans protestng againt the government during the thirties for increased pensions and land reform, a strange populist faction composed of well armed but war-tired veterans. MacArthur has proposed to once more call on them, and their experience, to liberate America once more."
  america_deluge_doug_commands: "Doug Commands"
  america_deluge_doug_commands_desc: "We need to further centralize the army structure. MacArthur needs to know what are generals are doing, and have an absolute grip over our soldiers and generals.

  deluge_maritimes2title: "The Boston Government and the Diarchy"
  deluge_maritimes2desc: "When Butler occupied Philadelphia and the king fled to Africa, hiding in Liberia like a robber or an assassin, many believed that monarchism in America was dead forever. Little knew those fouls that former Prime Minister Kennedy had been preparing for the revolution for months now. He had made contacts with prominent army leaders, setting up a Defence Plan called "Plab White" with veteran Douglas MacArthur, quickly promoted to Supreme Commander of the American White Army. Kennedy has assumed the role of Regent of the Boston Provisional Government, while MacArthur is commander in chief of the armed forces. A loyalist congress has taken office in Boston, composed only of Federalists and rightist Whighs. Congress acts as a rubber stamp to Kennedy and MacArthur's decisions, which now basically share absolute executive power. Kennedy as promised a return to constitutionalism as soon as possible, but fear of an oligarchic takeover or an army coup by the "American Napoleon" is still high in Boston."

Supreme Geneal MacArthur has observed that we lack the manpower to defeat the reds, and while we still have massive amounts of arms seized by the Kingdom's armeries, we lack the industrial base and manpower to properly face our foes. MacArthur has announced a massive conscription spree through the nation to sustain our oversized army."

  deluge_maritimes4desc: "A delegation of Chicago industrialists has met Kennedy. These businessmen fear that the more radical elements of the revolution may take power in Philadelphia and destroy the institution of American capitalism that have led our great nation to prosperity. Among them there are some who would be considered "oligarchs": the man who held control of American monopolies before the revolution. Kennedy has often stated the need to reform Americna institutions and break up too large monopolies, with MacArthur even promising to destroy them. However it is clear that for now the Boston Government recognizes the oligarch's influence and even supports them to a small extent."

  deluge_maritimes5optb: "Nay!"
  deluge_maritimes6title: "The Colonial Garrison arrives in Boston"
  deluge_maritimes6desc: "In record time, the Liberians have crossed the atlantic and have managed to deploy three divisions in Boston. King John has expressed his support for the Boston Government and has exorted the international community to recognize Kennedy as interim regent of America (as if the European monarchs needed any further encouragement to delegitimaze the reds in Philadelphia). Kennedy has expressed his gratitude towards the king, but he has also stressed the need to deeply reform America, and he seems more busy to build his own base of support thanr estoring John"
  deluge_maritimes6opt: "Another succes for the Kennedy administration"
  deluge_maritimes7title: "John II insults us!"
  deluge_maritimes7desc: "John Hamiltonian has mocked our request, saying that he wouldn't support any government which didn't openly recognize him as the true legitimate King and immediately restore him as King of America. Kennedy knws doing so now would be massively unpopular and difficult, and while he appeals to loyalists and royalists, knowing the incompetence of John II he would never dare to restore him during a bloody civil war."

  deluge_maritimes8title: "The Esihenower Line"

He stressed that given that we may not be abl to capture Philadelphia in the next days, we must prepare to defend Boston too, building a defence line to gain time before we could launch a counterattack. Kennedy has viewed this idea with suspecioun, fearing a prolonged war may cause a military coup."
  deluge_maritimes8opt: "We must protect America"
  deluge_maritimes9title: "The Constitution of the Boston Provisional Government"
  deluge_maritimes9desc: "The Provisional Congress in Boston has today fully ratified the old American Constitution, in an attempt to solidify our position as the legitimate succesor to the Federal Kingdom of America. However, an emendament has been added, granting emergency powers to the Prime Minister in case of war and special executive roles to the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, now a position separated from the King (and now taken by Douglas MacArthur).\n\nA few weeks ago, before the ratification of the constitution, special elections were held in the region, in order to fill the congress with representatives. They resulted in a landslide victory for the Federalist Party, now fully transformed into Kennedy's personal political machine. However New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who evacuated to New England in the past weeks, has managed to re establish the Whigh Party and has managed to create a strong liberal and socially progressive force in the country. Dewey has a lot of influence in Congress and has pledged to do whatever it takes tu uphold true American freedom."

  deluge_maritimes10title: "The question of the King"
  deluge_maritimes10desc: "While the Boston Provisional Government claims to be the legal succesor to the Federal Kingdom of America, many question therefore why king John Hamilton II isn't sitting on the throne. Kennedy himself has addressed this issue, with a convincing speech which however raises more doubts than it clears:\n\n"The Federalist Party and the Congress assembled in boston both stand for American monarchy and capitalism, which by the grace of God have led our nation to prosperity. However, the recent events have shown that John Hamilton lacks the support from his people, the same support they gave to George I Washington and Alexander I Hamilton. If the people's trust in John II isn't restored, the constitution forbids us from re-crowning him as King of the Americans. We will investigate the charge of tyranny moved against the king and in case it will be proven to be true we'll choose a more fitting candidate to lead the American people.""

  deluge_maritimes11title: "The American Napoleon"
  deluge_maritimes11desc: "A worrying report has appeared today on regent Kennedy's desk... It seems like a personality cult is being built around general Dougals MacArthur, the American Napoleon and the Hero of the Battle of Bermuda. The people identify him, and his military genius, as the only thing which could save the government and liberate America. MacArthur's rise in popularity may mean that a military coup in America could be possible if we let the Army rule unchecked."

  deluge_maritimes12title: "MacArthur proposes War Plan: Red"
  deluge_maritimes12desc: "With the Civil War raging on the American continent, Marshall MacArthur has started his grand army reform plan. MacArthur aims at unifying the high command, centralizing the army structure and establishing a verticistic organization with him at its aim. After the centralization and streamline of the army, MacArthur will rely on Kennedy's "New Industrial Policy"  to provide artillery to our forces, which will crush the enemy with our superior firepower. MacArthur also has developed a mroe detailed War Plan against the Republicans, nicknamed "War Plan Red", which consists of refusing to attack well defended strongholds and instead focus on the rural areas, where support for the socialists is more sparse and the people are more sympathetic to the loyalist cause"

  deluge_maritimes13desc: "The American Army was seriously underfounded after the Great War, and it was mostly demobilized and waekened from the great faust of the African trenches and the battles in the Carribean and the Atlantic. However, Kennedy maanged to gather a quite large amount of rifles and muntions before the revolution, and with the government issuing a general inventory of the supplies hold by the Boston Provisional Government, we are finally ready to supply the army with our weapons. Kennedy has also integrated two former generals into the army, further strengthening our army command. MacArthur has protested the slowness of our burocratic system, and has spoken against supposed "unwillingness" from Kennedy to proper supply the army, as if the Regent was trying to weaken and question MacArthur's leadership."

AN association of retired Great War Veterans, most of them while aging are well trained and well armed, and are not comparable to the red unexperienced labour militias. MacArthur, before even consulting with Kennedy, has promised them "land and freedom," announcing massive land reforms to crush the "traitors oligarchs who betrayed the King." While many are skeptic of MacArthur's treu intentions, most veterans trust him, and are ready to join the army. Even old General of the Armies John Pershing, the supreme commander of the American Expeditionary fore in Germany and Italy, who participated at the battle of Rome, has offered his service. Pershing is old, and will mostly be used as a propaganda figure, but his support gives greath weight to MacArthus's words, and many in Boston won't sleep tonight..."

He argued that blacks can help us resolving our great manpower shortage, and has demanded that the government should condemn Jim Crow Laws in the South, outlaw the KKK and even go as far as publicaly denouncing southern racism.\n\n[MAR.GetLeader], a Conservative himself, while not directly opposed to black emancipation, is at the very least skeptik of this concept, fearing that it could cause the South to further distrust our regime. However given the current war situation against the Dixies, he has stated that he's open to the idea of all black army units, and a gradual desegregation of the Boston (and hopefully Federal in the future) Government."

The rebels have very weak numbers, with only three brigades, but we suspect the Boston government is supporting them against us.

They know the longer the war lasts, the more we risk a coup from MacArthur, and for this reason they want to provide a strong political framework that will safeguard American democracy when the civil war ends. While a few people whisper Kennedy wants to crown himself King of America, the question of the next American monacrh is still to be answered.\n\nKennedy obviously has chosen to not uncover his cards, while MacArthur has endorsed John Hamilton's Son, Alexander Hamilton. Dewey and the liberals have decided, to counterbalance MacArthur's influence, to entroduce absolute primogeniture and allow Alexander's older sister Helen Hamilton to become the first American Queen. Kennedy believes a strong constitutional monarchy headed by Helen will be our best option to safeguard the Kingdom from MacArthur, at least if his own ambitions don't succeed..."

It isn't Lovecraft however to run the Columbian show. Many of the men who meet in the darkness of his living room are foremr New York polticians, the ones who created Tammany Hall.

James Grant Forbes, of the rich Forbes noble family and proud member of the Providence Clique, has approached Kennedy, offering him to build contacts between us and Ford, wherever he may have taken refuge.\n\nIt is clear that the oligarchs of America have their own dark plots and plan for our nation, but smuggling Ford's weapon or even securing a part of his immense wealth may help us in our struggle."

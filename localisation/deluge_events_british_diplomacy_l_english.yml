 deluge_anti_commonwealth_sentiment_desc: "The people are in uproar at their loss of political freedom. They have started to oppose the British overlordship of their nation and may seek to topple the Dominion government violently."
 british_diplomacy1title: "Britain Offers Alliance"
 british_diplomacy1desc: "Diplomats of [From.GetNameDef] have approached us with the offer of a military alliance. In exchange for mutual protection in future wars, they will fully recognise our ownership of the African and Indian colonies we were awarded in the Treaty of Versailles."
 british_diplomacy1opta: "Our ancient alliance is restored."
 british_diplomacy1optb: "No, those colonies are already ours."
 british_diplomacy2title: "Portugal Joins Commonwealth"
 british_diplomacy2desc: "Today the Portuguese and British governments agreed to a military alliance between their nations. In exchange for reiterating the legitimacy of Portuguese ownership of the former British colonies of Kenya, Mysore and others, [Root.GetNameDef] entered the Commonwealth as an observer nation."
 british_diplomacy2opta: "Unsettling."
 british_diplomacy2optb: "Our ancient alliance is restored."
 british_diplomacy2optc: "We have put Versailles behind us."
 british_diplomacy3title: "Portugal Snubs Britain"
 british_diplomacy3desc: "Diplomatic discussions between Britain and Portugal broke down today as the Portuguese envoys withdrew from the negotiations.\n\nThe Portuguese and British foreign ministries declined to comment further."
 british_diplomacy3opta: "Interesting."
 british_diplomacy3optb: "They pile insult on top of injury!"
 british_diplomacy3optc: "We had nothing to gain from the arrangement."
 british_diplomacy4title: "Britain Claims Ireland"
 british_diplomacy4desc: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has issued a report documenting alleged abuses of the Ulster Protestants by the Irish government, and that as eternal protectors of the loyal Orangemen they are entitled to intervene for humanitarian reasons."
 british_diplomacy4opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy4optb: "To victory!"
 british_diplomacy4optc: "Lunatics! We must prepare our defences!"
 british_diplomacy5title: "Dominions and Commonwealth"
 british_diplomacy5desc: "The Dominions are the self-governing British colonies. This movement towards partial sovereignty has taken a hundred years, and it was about to take a new step forwards with the introduction of the Commonwealth system. Regrettably, with the recent passing of King George V in January (may God rest his soul), the project was halted. Now that Edward VIII is formally inaugurated, it can proceed. With his royal assent, of course.\n\nParliament are eager to see their king continue the trend towards constitutionalism, although elements of the armed forces are trying to frustrate this process."
 british_diplomacy5opta: "Responsible government is a worthy goal."
 british_diplomacy5optb: "We prefer the status quo."
 british_diplomacy5optc: "The Empire cannot afford sentimentality."
 british_diplomacy6title: "British Imperialism"
 british_diplomacy6desc: "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have informed our government of their desire to fundamentally change the relationship between ourselves and the mother nation. Rather than continue with the Commonwealth reforms and grant us true sovereignty and self-rule, they intend to reverse the existing reforms, turning the colonial governors into autocrats implementing London's diktats."
 british_diplomacy6opta: "We must persevere through these insults."
 british_diplomacy6optb: "Sovereignty is worth killing and dying for."
 british_diplomacy7title: "Traitors"
 british_diplomacy7desc: "The [From.GetAdjective] colonial governor, [From.GetLeader], has informed Whitehall that the legally dissolved legislature of the Dominion is in a state of outright rebellion. They 'respectfully' decline to implement the reforms we have decided upon and are in the process of declaring some kind of republican, or at least anti-British, government. They say that 'sovereignty is worth killing and dying for'."
 british_diplomacy7opta: "Crush the traitors!"
 british_diplomacy7optb: "We must allow them to leave the Commonwealth."
 british_diplomacy8title: "Leaving The Commonwealth"
 british_diplomacy8desc: "We have finally freed ourselves of the baleful influence of [From.GetNameDef]. We can no longer legitimise our state through association with the decrepit British monarchy. We need a new constitution. A new social contract. A new ideology."
 british_diplomacy8opta: "Rule of law and limited democracy."
 british_diplomacy8optb: "Radical democracy and republicanism."
 british_diplomacy8optc: "Ethnic nationalism."
 british_diplomacy9title: "British Invasion"
 british_diplomacy9desc: "Forces from the hated British oppressor have landed on Irish shores for the first time since the end of the Napoleonic wars. Though we carefully guarded our neutrality in the past, with the onset of war it seems little can save us from annexation and a return to colonisation. Perhaps we should surrender in exchange for continued existance as a Dominion of Britain?"
 british_diplomacy9opta: "Negotiate a surrender."
 british_diplomacy9optb: "Never! We will throw back the sassenachs or perish!"
 british_diplomacy10title: "Irish Surrender"
 british_diplomacy10desc: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] have communicated their desire for surrender in exchange for continued existance as a Dominion realm within the Commonwealth."

 british_diplomacy11title: "Ireland Surrenders"
 british_diplomacy11desc: "The British government today accepted proposals by a delegation from the Irish government to turn Ireland into a formal Dominion of the Commonwealth. British troops had landed in force and the Irish government evidently felt unable to repel them."
 british_diplomacy11opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy11optb: "A satisfactory conclusion."
 british_diplomacy11optc: "A sad day."
 british_diplomacy12title: "Britain Rejects Surrender"
 british_diplomacy12desc: "The British government today rejected proposals by a delegation from the Irish government to turn Ireland into a formal Dominion of the Commonwealth. British troops have landed in force and this announcement appears to indicate the intent is outright annexation of Ireland, rather than the creation of a puppet state."
 british_diplomacy12opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy12optb: "To victory!"
 british_diplomacy12optc: "Bastards!"

 british_diplomacy13title: "Commonwealth Reforms"
 british_diplomacy13desc: "The defence and colonial policies of [From.GetNameDef] have recently undergone large changes with the rolling out of the Commonwealth reforms.\n\nThis marks the cementing of self-rule in the old British Dominions. The imperial governors are now largely symbolic, and the legislatures are assuming full sovereignty.\n\n[From.GetLeader] now presides over an alliance of equals, rather than a centralised empire."
 british_diplomacy13opta: "They still have a tyrant in charge."
 british_diplomacy13optb: "Splendid!"
 british_diplomacy13optc: "This is a threat to the natural order!"
 british_diplomacy13optd: "This is dangerously close to radicalism."
 british_diplomacy14title: "Commonwealth Reforms Sidelined"
 british_diplomacy14desc: "The changes to the defence and colonial policies of [From.GetNameDef] have stalled recently.\n\nThe imperial governors have been directed to abandon attempts at devolving full sovereignty to the legislatures of the Dominions.\n\n[From.GetLeader] appears to be concerned over the rising instability in the world, and has overturned the steps towards democracy the late King George V had been taking."
 british_diplomacy14opta: "Typical tyrant behaviour."
 british_diplomacy14optb: "This is very concerning."
 british_diplomacy14optc: "The natural order is being upheld."
 british_diplomacy14optd: "The monarchy is still a decadent institution."
 british_diplomacy15title: "Commonwealth Reforms Reversed"
 british_diplomacy15desc: "The late King George V had been implementing gradual changes to the defence and colonial policies of [From.GetNameDef], but these Commonwealth Reforms appear to have come to an end with the coronation of the stern imperialist Edward VIII.\n\nThe cabinet appointed under [From.GetLeader] is seeking greater centralisation of the Dominions and has demanded the dissolution of the colonial legislatures."
 british_diplomacy15opta: "The fatcats were concerned for their profits."
 british_diplomacy15optb: "This is very concerning."
 british_diplomacy15optc: "This may be going too far."
 british_diplomacy15optd: "With these powers, radicals and traitors will tremble!"

 british_diplomacy16desc: "Diplomats of [From.GetNameDef] have approached us with the offer of a military alliance. In exchange for mutual protection in future wars, they will fully recognise our ownership of Ceylon and Gibraltar, which we were awarded at the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThis is a good opportunity to coerce the French into returning Catalonia to us. By threatening to join the British, they will be compelled to give in and undo Napoleon I's harmful mistake."
 british_diplomacy16opta: "Our former enemy will become our ally."
 british_diplomacy16optb: "See if the French will return Catalonia."
 british_diplomacy16optc: "Spain must look after her own interests."
 british_diplomacy16optd: "Europe will not return to war any time soon."
 british_diplomacy17title: "Spain Seeks Return of Catalonia"
 british_diplomacy17desc: "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have approached us with a demand for the return of Catalonia in exchange for a military alliance. They say the British are offering them a military pact in exchange for recognising Spanish gains in the Treaty of Versailles. If we do not accept the Spanish offer, Spain will align with Britain and seize Catalonia if we ever go to war with the British."
 british_diplomacy17opta: "We are pleased to renew our alliance with Spain."
 british_diplomacy17optb: "Catalonia will always be French."
 british_diplomacy18title: "France Rejects Alliance"
 british_diplomacy18desc: "The French have declined to return Catalonia to us. However, the British offer is still open. We could also form our own faction, to ensure Spain's interests are upheld."
 british_diplomacy18opta: "Accept the British offer."
 british_diplomacy18optc: "Spain will lead a mighty alliance!"
 british_diplomacy18optd: "We will remain neutral."
 british_diplomacy19title: "Anglo-Spanish Alliance"
 british_diplomacy19desc: "The governments of Spain and Britain have agreed to a military alliance. In future wars, the two governments will not sign separate peace agreements with mutual belligerents.\n\nThe British government has also quietly ended its demands for the return of Gibraltar and Ceylon, territories seized by Spain at the conclusion of the Great War.\n\nThis alliance is surely intended for waging war against France."
 british_diplomacy19opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy19optb: "Outrageous!"
 british_diplomacy19optc: "A toast to our new friends!"
 british_diplomacy20title: "Franco-Spanish Alliance"
 british_diplomacy20desc: "The governments of Spain and France have agreed to a military alliance. In future wars, the two governments will not sign separate peace agreements with mutual belligerents.\n\nThe French government has also ceded control over Catalonia to the Spanish. This rich region was taken from Spain during the Napoleonic Wars, but Spain has repeatedly requested its return in the past. It seems France was worried enough about an Anglo-Spanish alliance to finally return it after a hundred years of French control."
 british_diplomacy20opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy20optb: "Outrageous!"
 british_diplomacy20optc: "A toast to our new friends!"
 british_diplomacy21title: "Spain Repudiates Britain"
 british_diplomacy21desc: "Diplomatic talks between Spain and Britain have ended with the Spanish government withdrawing her representatives. [From.GetNameDefCap] later declared that the other great powers could not be trusted to uphold Spain's interests abroad. [From.GetLeader] has now announced the creation of a Spanish bloc, although no other members have come forwards."
 british_diplomacy21opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy21optb: "Outrageous!"
 british_diplomacy21optc: "Long live [From.GetLeader]!"
 british_diplomacy22title: "Spain Repudiates Britain"
 british_diplomacy22desc: "Diplomatic talks between Spain and Britain have ended with the Spanish government withdrawing her representatives. [From.GetLeader] later declared that the prospect of future European wars was slim enough that Spain should not worry about allying herself with a great power. This optimism has been greeted by the international press with applause and derision in equal measure."
 british_diplomacy22opta: "A welcome change in tone."
 british_diplomacy22optb: "Peace will always prevail."
 british_diplomacy22optc: "Ridiculous!"
 british_diplomacy23title: "Britain Claims Quebec"
 british_diplomacy23desc: "British propaganda has recently placed its sights on Quebec, or 'Canada', as they have taken to calling it in reference to the brief period of British control over the region.\n\nThe Quebecois government has condemned British military maneuvers in the North Atlantic and has declared it will defend its territory to the last man."
 british_diplomacy23opta: "Concerning."

 british_diplomacy23optc: "Bastards!"
 british_diplomacy24title: "Britain Claims the Carribean"
 british_diplomacy24desc: "The Carribean islands seized by America during the Great War have become the focus of a dispute by [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] insists that the islands be returned and the Treaty of Versailles repudiated.\n\nNeedless to say, the American government is unlikely to acquiesce, and a new war seems likely."
 british_diplomacy24opta: "Concerning."
 british_diplomacy24optb: "To victory!"
 british_diplomacy24optc: "Bastards!"
 british_diplomacy25title: "British Monarchy Abolished"
 british_diplomacy25desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has today announced the formal abolition of the British monarchy. All titles of nobility are now voided, the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall have been nationalised, and all droits of the crown will now escheat to the government.\nMany monarchist supporters are in a state of shock as the ancient House of Windsor faces the possibility of disappearing into the history books. Previously known as the House of Hanover, the Anglified name was adopted in 1817 to underscore the loss of the old Electorate of Hanover to Napoleon's Continental System.\nPresident [From.GetLeader] congratulated the legislature on forging a path to the future based not on dynasty and bloodlines, but upon the support of the people."
 british_diplomacy25opta: "A resounding victory for the people."
 british_diplomacy25optb: "A victory for reason over reaction."
 british_diplomacy25optc: "This is a crime against tradition!"
 british_diplomacy25optd: "It will be sad to see the Windsors vanish."

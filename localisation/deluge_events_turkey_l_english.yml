 deluge_turkey1title: "Mustafa Kemal Pasha Passes Away"
 deluge_turkey1desc: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] has suffered a tragedy today, as one of the heroes of the nation, Mustafa Kemal Pasha, passed away of an illness. He was 55. His victories over Russia in the Great War won him wide acclaim.\n\nNow our nation mourns, but we also ponder our future. Kemal Pasha was himself a leading advocate of the Young Turks, but reconciled his political faction with the Sultan's continued reign in order to prevent a ruinous civil war breaking out. We must consider how we want his legacy to be remembered."
 deluge_turkey1opta: "He was the father of the nation."
 deluge_turkey1optb: "He was a brilliant general, nothing more."

 deluge_turkey2opta: "Constitutional monarchy is still an injustice."
 deluge_turkey2optb: "Splendid!"
 deluge_turkey2optc: "Disappointing."
 deluge_turkey2optd: "He was a rabble-rousing traitor."
 deluge_turkey3title: "Turkey Moves Towards Absolutism"
 deluge_turkey3desc: "Today [From.GetNameDef] mourned the death of a war hero, Mustafa Kemal Pasha.\n\nAn accomplished general during the Great War, he later participated in political intrigue that almost toppled the ancient House of Osmanli, but brought Turkey back from the brink of civil war by reconciling the republicans and monarchists.\n\nThe absolutist sovereign, [From.GetLeader], has repudiated the idea of Kemal Pasha being a 'father of Turkey', accepting only his legacy as a brilliant general."
 deluge_turkey3opta: "Co-operating with tyrants is pointless."
 deluge_turkey3optb: "Disappointing."

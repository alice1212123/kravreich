Making speeches and visting the local garrisons in an attempt to solidfy Prussian control especcialy in the once owned radical states specifically. Upon his depature from Essen his convoy reached Dortmund. He stayed in a local hotel to wait the night out where he would then give his respected speeches though this wouldn't be the case. Guards stationed at the hotel heard a sudden bang originating from August Von Mackensen room. After guard inspection it was concluded that Mackensen's death was contributed by a poisonous pill of some sort put in by what is thought to be a radical sympathiser who posed as a waiter."

Whatever the case may be it doesn't seem that Berinhard Heinz is a suspect though we have recieved some vital information from the young man. He states that during the closure of the GCW various pro-radical individuals gathered together at the local muesum, mentioning something about an assasination attempt on Mackensen if he was to ever arrive at Dortmund. He targeted the local museum as being the place where he over heard this announcement and has given us the respected date when he heard this.\n\n§G The information we currently have is that a group of pro-radical individuals mentioned an assassination attempt on Mackensen in the local muesum.§!"

Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt after a lifetime of service to the nation.\n\nThe apparent successor is currently Reinhard von Halle, the commander of the paramilitary Teutonic Knights, but the senior military staff dislike his uncompromising zealotry and would prefer a more pragmatic and secular military dictatorship. This opposition has coalesced around experienced General Staff officer Werner von Blomberg. Additionally, many Prussian aristocrats are backing a Hohenzollern restoration, but they have little support within the army."

Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt.\n\nThe new leader of Germany is [From.GetLeader], a veteran General Staff officer. The paramilitary wing of the state, the 'Teutonic Knights', have begun to lose credibility thanks to their excesses against Jews during the civil war and their leader, Reinhard von Halle, has been purged from the new government.

Our new Hohenzollern monarch will restore the prestige of the German people. The precise nature of the new monarchy has yet to be announced to the world, though. Many Prussian aristocrats would prefer to keep the name of the old realm which faced Napoleon in battle at Jena and Dresden. Nationalists desire an Empire to rival that of the French.

The Prussian aristocracy has presented Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, a descendent of the old Kings of Prussia, as a compromise candidate. [From.GetNameDefCap], recently declared by [From.GetLeader], has the support of enough German nationalists to make an attempt at a German monarchy without a French king."

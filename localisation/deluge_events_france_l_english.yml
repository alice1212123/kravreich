 deluge_france1title: "May Day"
 deluge_france1desc: "The first of May has been a day of solidarity for labour movements around the world since 1851, when an unruly mob of striking Parisian textile workers were justly brought to order by gendarmes. It has also been a day of apprehension for the ruling classes since 1866, when strikes turned to revolution and kings fled from their palaces in fear. No sovereign wishes to see a return to those chaotic days, so the Paris parade was heavily vetted and controlled by police. We pray there will be no disturbances; however, this is very unlikely. Maurcie Thorez and his Jacobins have announced a massive strike in Paris to protest against the monarchy, and blood could be spilled."
 deluge_france1opt: "We remain vigilant."
 deluge_france2title: "Blood in the streets of Paris"
 deluge_france2desc: "Napoleon IV watched in horror from the balcony of his palace in Paris as Thorez strike turned violent; he decided to personally adress the crowd of protesting workers, hoping probably to relieve the social tensions that are weakening France. Sadly a worker participating in the strike throw a rock in the direction of the Emperor, and without direct orders from Napoleon IV the French police started firing on him. Soon blood was spilled with more than 20 strikers dead and many guards injured. Napoleon was forced to flee from the city fearing for his life. Fortunatly violence didn't escalate, and calm returned to Paris with the end of the day. However radical politicians on both sides are criticizing the event, with Thorez blaiming the police for their violence and the Integralist Charles Maurras demanding a suspension of strikers's rigths. "

 deluge_france3desccommunism: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the British policy of international revolution will end immediately. The aggression shown by the British republicans is beyond alarming, it has caused outrage in [From.GetNameDef]. The British republic will soon see the might of the Continental System arrayed against her."
 deluge_france3descdemocratic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued a statement condemning the actions of the British state. [From.GetLeader] is believed to be gathering support for a declaration of war, and fleets are already putting to sea to resolve the disputes between the two nations. For the second time in living memory, the English Channel will once again become a battlefield."
 deluge_france3descneutrality: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that British imperialism must be contained once again. [From.GetNameDef] smashed Perfidious Albion in the Napoleonic Wars and the Great War, and the public believe they can win again. The British king is unlikely to get away with the relatively mild terms of Versailles this time around."
 deluge_france3descfascism: "The mounting expansionism shown by the British Empire has alarmed the government of [From.GetNameDef], to the point that [From.GetLeader] considers war the only suitable response. The many nations the British seek to subjugate will no doubt be relieved that the Continental System is finally being brought to bear against the British ultranationalists."

The full military force of [From.GetNameDef] is believed to be mobilising against the Polish republic. The old Wettin kings of Poland failed to resist the Continental System - will the republic fare any better?"
 deluge_france4descdemocratic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] appears to be mobilising her forces against the Polish state. [From.GetLeader] has decried the threat to European stability posed by Poland, and demands the immediate withdrawal of Polish troops from all contested territories. It does not seem likely that Poland will comply."
 deluge_france4descneutrality: "The empire building of the Polish kingdom has drawn the ire of [From.GetLeader]. Declaring that the balance of power has been shifted irrevecably, the government of [From.GetNameDef] seems to be mobilising her armies to invade Poland in a re-enactment of the Great War. But with modern tanks and aircraft, will the outcome be different this time?"
 deluge_france4descfascism: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the Polish ultranationalists are an enemy of peaceful European civilisation and has demanded the immediate demobilisation of the Polish armed forces. As compliance with the demand seems incredibly unlikely, [From.GetNameDef] also appears to be mobilising for war against Poland."

Denying the Russian rhetoric of bringing peace and democracy to her troubled neighbours, [From.GetLeader] states that Russia is a menace that must be brought to order. The armed forces are mobilising for what looks to be a terrifying conflict."
 deluge_france5descneutrality: "The imperialism of the Russians has been condemned by the government of [From.GetNameDef].

This does not seem likely to happen, so the [From.GetAdjective] armed forces are also mobilising for war."

 deluge_france6descdemocratic: "[From.GetLeader] has stated that the Japanese are exceeding the limits of [From.GetAdjective] patience. [From.GetNameDef] is mobilising her armed forces, and look set to wage a total war against Japan. The [From.GetAdjective] public have been told that the Japanese are warmongers seizing colonies at will, and the public seems eager to destroy this threat to European hegemony."

The world order created by Napoleon I is being overturned and [From.GetNameDef]'s position is threatened. The young American republic may now face her former ally in the field of battle. [From.GetAdjective] fleets are even now steaming from ports to contest dominance of the Atlantic sealanes."
 deluge_france7descdemocratic: "Recent American expansionism is threatening [From.GetNameDef]'s position of dominance in the world. [From.GetLeader] has declared that the American state must be contained before she spreads further and becomes too large a rival for the European empires to contest. It seems likely that the two powers will clash soon on the field of battle."

 deluge_france10desc: "Today has seen one of the largest parades in living memory, even larger than the 1936 May Day march. The devastating post-war economic adjustment has left millions of Frenchmen out of work, and they are marching in the streets with the trades unionists, socialists and republicans to voice their anger. The huge size of the demonstration was noticed by the entire nation."

The Jacobins have a large audience to spread their dangerous ideals to thanks to the troubled times we find ourselves in. Perhaps a million Frenchmen have taken to the streets in the largest demonstration in living memory. Anti-war sentiments are strong and we should be on the alert for agitators in the crowds."

 deluge_france12title: "May Day, 1937"
 deluge_france12desc: "The socialists and Jacobins have taken to the streets, alongside upwards of a million unemployed Frenchmen angry at the government's economic policies. The largest demonstration in living memory has coalesced to support the German Communists we have been suppressing. Reports on the ground indicate outright treason is brewing, with police stations in several cities besieged by rioting mobs. The situation is incredibly dangerous for our government."
 deluge_france12opt: "Nothing a few rifle volleys can't solve."
 deluge_france13title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france13desc: "Another year, another ridiculous parade of dirty labourers and angry layabouts to police. With our nation at peace and still suffering the effects of the recent economic downturn, the radicals have a large audience to spread their ideas, but not much opportunity to act on them. Unemployment remains in the hundreds of thousands, but is decreasing."
 deluge_france13opt: "Things are calming down gradually."
 deluge_france14title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france14desc: "Anti-war demonstrations have been joined by socialist and trades unionist marchers all over France to protest at our government's defence policies. Popular opinion marginally favours the radicals, and their strength should not be underestimated. They are joined by hundreds of thousands of unemployed Frenchmen still suffering from the effects of the post-war adjustment."
 deluge_france14opt: "Send in the gendarmes to crack some skulls."
 deluge_france15title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france15desc: "Our policy of intervention in the German Civil War has drawn the ire of socialists and Jacobins. With hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen still out of work, today's parade has been huge, and the marchers place the blame for their misfortune directly on our 'tyrannical' government. Violent disorder has been reported in several departments, with riots against the government resulting in several dead and hundreds wounded. A firm response is needed to show the troublemakers that we will not tolerate their incitement."

 deluge_france16title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france16desc: "The trades unionist marchers had a good turnout today, although decidedly lower than that of the past few years. It seems that the improved economy and long period of peace have together undermined many of the arguments of the leftists. Capitalism is no longer on the brink of collapse, and the government is winning back some of the popularity it lost during the Great War. While the socialists will likely continue their marches in future, the monarchy seems to be safe from revolution."
 deluge_france16opt: "The crisis is finally over."
 deluge_france17title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france17desc: "Debates over opposition to the war dominated the trades unionist marchers today. The stronger economy has reduced unemployment and the 'warmongering' of the government is now the primary target of the radical opposition. While the leftists are an immediate threat, the light at the end of the tunnel is visible: if we manage to keep these demonstrations orderly, this should be the last major march for some time."
 deluge_france17opt: "Send in the gendarmes to crack some skulls."
 deluge_france18title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france18desc: "The booming economy has put to rest many of the radical arguments for deposing the monarchy, but our intervention in the German Civil War continues to infuriate them. Sporadic violence is reported in many cities, with policemen being attacked and government property vandalised. Still, unemployment is now very low, and if we can put this disorder to rest, we should be free of major obstacles to our rule for the foreseeable future."

Barricades were established in the blood-stained streets near police stations and army barracks, manned by radicals sympathetic to the communist cause. Large numbers of soldiers and sailors have defected, and although loyal security forces in Paris managed to protect the Emperor and the National Assembly, much of the country is now in open war, with the capital of a provisional republican government declared in Limoges."

However we cannot say that he has not been left scarred by this event; Napoleon IV has always been concerned with his image, and his reputation as "Emperor of the people" may very well be damaged by all this violence. He knows that a strong France needs to be stable first, and he's ready to act and take drastic decisions to save the Empire from the forces which want to tear it apart."

Déat was considered too close with jacobins and his repblicans tendencies isolated the RNP from the other parties on the rigth, such as Maurras's Integralists. Déat has now been replaced by the popular radio speaker and "La Fraternitè" director Philippe Henriot, an ultra-catholic who wishes to create a corporatist and populist state, without necessarly abolishing the monarchy. Henriot's sheer charisma worries moderate parties across France, and with this possible rise in popularity the ultranationalist may well get some seats in the French government."

While he assured that his party "is not Republican in any way", he also ammited that "Laval has failed the French people and the French Emperor. The people need to be heared once again to decide the future of our country; I'll stand as usual for socialdemocracy and an extension of workers's rigths, all in the respect of the Empire's costitution." Polls show that Blum's social democrats may very well become the largest party in case of a new election, with him "stealing" votes both from the Jacobins and the Parti of Order."

This is not the first time the emperor dissolves parliament to "obey to the will of the people:" in 1934, short after the Great War, he dissolved the government of National Unity that lead France during the Great War, and demanded a general election to be held soon after. Laval was elected Prime Minister in that occasion, but his popularity sharply fell after the economic crisis that hit Europe two years ago and his generally reactionary methods.

He personally wished for the king to suspend parliament indefinitevly, bringing back an absolutist monarchy after the Great War. He has even been accused of Bourbon symapties! This controversial figure however has the firm support of the Catholic Church and the peasents in the countryside, and may very well be a key figure in the next election campaign.

He has dismissed critics from Thorez and the Jacobins affirming that the police simply used violence against violent people. Laval has later attacked Blum, accusing him of secretly being a Jacobin and plotting to overthrow the Emperor. Blum on the other hand dismissed this accusasions as blatant antisemitism and ignorance.

Daladier is the official head of the opposition in Parliament, leading the second largest party, but experts say that he may very well soon be replaced by Leon Blum as the most prominent moderate democratic politician in France.

He asked the Emperor to publically withdraw his approval of Monatte's goals and has also affirmed that "the militay will always been loyal to the Emperor and will intervene if asked so."\n\nThis outrageous declaration in practice states that Petain would gladly organize a military coup! Napoleon IV  has answered to critics assuring that democracy will remain in France, and further affronts from Petain will not be tolerated.

Thorez denounced the case as "the military taking the role of the civilian government", while Petain defended himself affirming that he "holds no duty to the strikers, only to the Empire."

Maurras's integralists however soon protested and even went as far as interrupting the Emperor's speech, demanding that he assumed absolute power. Marcel Déat, the former ultranationalist leader, accused the Emperor of "radical concessions" and demanded his abdication; soon later Thorez's radicals started shouting and protesting against the far-rigth, and it took all the Emperor's efforts to prevent an open figth to take place in Parliament!"

The Orleans family was the only branch of the Bourbon royal house that didn't flee to Louisiana following the Revolution, and since then they have had a prominent role in French politics. Emperor Napoleon I issued an imperial perdon to the Orleans, and even garnted them territories and lands. Now however the Orleans have become a bastion of reactionarism, and the "L'Humanité" speculates that there is a secret plan involving a Bourbon restorations to the French trone. Maurras har responded to these critics dismissing them as socialist lies, going as far as affirming that "this is exactly the reason why we need a state-controlled press.""

He too denounced the newspaper, and even attacked the Emperor himself for allowing such jurnalists to exist in France. Henriot cited many "Humanité" articles denouncing the church and corporatist politicies, calling them a part of the "neo judeo conspiracy against Christ, the Empire and the Holy See." Accorign to Henriot the "internationalist jews are already ruling France, and are the cause of all the troubles that hit our country in the last decades, including the start of the Great War." Antisemitism has always been a key feature of the French far-rigth, with even Maurras adopting some questionable policies, but no one went as far as Henriot is doing now. These populist policies may drain votes from the traditional catholic parties in France, such as the Party of Order and the AF."

Blum asked for the content of the meeting to become public, and denounced the act as "a clear sign of corporatist tendencies inside our country." Thorez's Jacobins even accused the Emperor of being a puppet of big business, a mere executor of the rich's will. While it is unlikely that these critics will bring an end to our monarchy, these word only deepen the fracture inside the democratic factions in France.

Thorez stressed the need of a united socialist alliance that would run in the next elections as a "united, popular front for welfare, democracy and socislism." The expression "Popular Front" has already become a catch-phrase in newspapers and journalistic language, with members both of the left and the rigth discussing this potential alliance. Blum has not yet decided if he wants to commit to this alliance; the upside are cear: if the front wins, Blum will surely become Prime Minister and bring the reforms he wants, but this shift to radicalism could scare the traditionally liberal electorate.

Laval was certain of his re-election just some months ago, but the future of France is now ensure as it has never been in the last years.

Maurras and Henriot have had a tense relationship in the past, with Maurras's supposed Bourbon sympaties and Henriot's republican tendencies, but it is unlikely that each party could achieve a majority in the next elections if they run alone.

When finally news came that the Popular Front was never created, Daladier rushed to Blum proposing his own idea: a united democratic alliance, to defeat extremists both on the left and the rigth. After the elections, the party with most votes will take leadership in the alliance and either Blum or Daladier will become prime minister. Blum will likely accept this offer, prefering by far a Daladier presidency than a Laval one. And if Blum runs alone, it means he will have very slim chances of getting elected."

Members of the opposition, including former Prime Minister Pierre Laval fear that Blum's exagerated optimist may cause an overtaxation of the French citizens, with an unsustainable financial situation. Blum assures that this won't happen, but he still need to be careful with his reforms. Charles Maurras has already called this plan to solve the French economic situation the "Rouge Donne," the "Red Deal", given its socialist tendencies. The term, at the start a mere mocking of the government actions, has sticked with the press and has now become an unofficial name for Blum's policies.\n\nAt the same time, if Blum doesn't complete his plan he may face criticism from the left, a traditional ally of him, and strikes will return to hit France."

Laval himself has denounced the law affriming that it strips power from the families, and Maurras went as far as asking for a complete abolition of the school-leaving age, leaving education to families, calling the proposed bill "an infringement of the parental authority."

These regions are also cosnervative and integralist strongholds, and Blum also hope to break their political hegemony in these areas. Daladier instead proposed a more limited plan, mainly in fear or the ultranationalist paramilitaries that haunt the west and could attack workers.

Thorez however assures that he's doing everything for the workers. The other choice is Camille Chautemps, a politician from the Party of Order often descrived as opportunistic in his rapid changes of policies.

Philippe Petain has already announced that he "won't in any way support the new government. This is not the government of the French Empire." Napeoleon IV on the other end has already expressed his support for Thorez, but most French citizens have seen this action as a last and bold try to hold the country together; the result has been a loss of trust in the Imperial Authorirty, and France may descend soon in a civil war."

The Emperor has always wished for stability and democracy most than any other thing, but now he could use this occasion to remove Blum in favour of a more moderate candidate, If Napoleon supports Blum the most radical elements of the revolters will surely accuse him of being weak, and a war would be needed to quell the insurrection.

The opposition may call this a "squallid political move to obtain votes from women and upstart students" and even the emperor is probably sceptic of such move, but with the now solid position of the Blum administration there is very little they can do.

In truth Thorez demanded more serious oppossition and a full scale revolution like the one that happened in Germany some years ago, but Blum has refused any possibility of armed warfare, believing that democracy would triumph at the end. Blum's optimism however seems to be unmotivated, as workers are already engaging in violence against the police in many cities in the North East of France.

The meeting was supposed to be a secret, but the Lion of Calais discovered it some days ago and instructed his collaborators inside the city. The explosion killed a total of 26 people, including Thorez, Blum and other revolutionary leaders. At the same time Petain has ordered a march on Dunkerque to quell the rebellion occouring in the north.

In a sign of portest, many rigth-wing parties didn't showed up in Parliament affirming that "this government no longer rapresents them", urging the Emperor to remove Thorez; the socialist quickly exploited this opportunity and voted Thorez's proposal into law; trucks full of rifles are already heading to major French cities where the workers were already preparing for the enacting of the law.

However this is also a very difficult political issue: many leftist parties suggest to avoid granting too many rigths to the Italian, fearing possible irredentist claims by the dictator Benito Mussolini, while the catholic rigth, mostly somewhat sympathetic with Mussolini's ultra-catholicism, suggest some degree of appeasement to avoid war.

Today most women have returned to traditional roles in society, but the dust is still settling from the war and many women now demand an increase in rigths and even push for fully equality. Napoleon IV has shown some simpathy to the suffragette, going as far as meeting suffragette leader Cécile Kahn during the war and promising her drastic changes. While Napoleon IV allowed women to vote in municipal elections, local supersititon and ultra-catholics have oftern caused prbolems with the actual enactment of such law. Daladier promised to clarify the issue of French women, but many elements of the far rigth look with suscipe to the suffragettes, maybe even beacuse of Kahn's jewish origins.

Even some radical leftists attacked "the rich jew banker" as a friend of reactionaries sometimes... Now however with strong anti-semite elements in the Polish and Teutonic governments the situation is worsening and organizations like Henriot's National Protection Leagues conduct raids on jews regularly.

While on paper it had to be a peaceful manifestation, many "activists" carried improvised weapons and were all dressed in black shirts imitating Italian and German ultranationalists. In response a strange mob combining Daladier liberal's supproters, Blum's socialists and even some jacobins gathered in Rue des Rosiers chanting "They shall not pass!" to the ultranationalist protestors. Even Camille Chautemps and Blum himself were present at the manifestation, but violence escalated anyway between the opposing faction until the Prime Minister himself asked the gendarmeries to intervene and disperse the crowd.

Even worse, the French suggest to gradually implement a democratic system, which would de facto limit the powers of Frederick II. While some think that this will bring us close to radicalism, Christian Democrats are more than enthusiastic to see a more open system.

These are only some of the examples of the changes made to the Code and partially destoryed its innovative principles. Now the goverment has proposed to "resotre the Code to its former greatness and revive Napoleon the Great's true will."

Since the time of Napoleon III the church has been exempted from all kinds of taxes and some of their pre-revolutionary lands restored to their ownership to the anger of the liberals.

Many of Henriot's men attended the mass wearing their caratheristic black shirts, and at the end of the celebration the Cardinal officialy blessed "the brave men figthing for bringing France back on the path of God."

The post-war economic instability has caused many families to be forced to send their children to the factories to earn enough money to keep decent living conditions. Blum's social democrats have already proposed a law that would increase the school-leaving age to 15 and crack down with special inspections against employers that have childrens in their factories.

One of these men is Cardinal Emmanuel Célestin Suhard, who has cried for the creation of the Workers-Priest. While in theory he needs support from the Vatican, we could help him financially instead in the difficult task of creating a catholic union-like movement.

He argued that military action should have been used since the beginning of the strike in order to not give the jacobin terrorists no time to organize. He called Prime Minister Laval a weak and ineffective politician, while also criticizng the Emperor for unacceptable silence on the socialists' actions. He calls for a mobilization of all true patriots against the government to safeguard the country, and ultranationalist violent demonstration have been rather common since the end of the war.

While the Laval's government is far from a police state, the arrest of Thorez caused massive outrage across all the political left, with even Blum criticizng Laval for his choices.

In the meantime a letter from the socialist leader has been published on "L'Humanité", claiming that the arrest attempt was a proof of burgeoise corruption and transition into a dictatorship.

The radical leader was found fully dressed and armed with an handgun, probably awaiting someone who would have carried him outside the city. Panicking, Thorez pointed his gun against one soldier and fired, hurting him at his arm. After some seconds of silence two other gunshots were heard in the nigth, then other two more. Four bullets perfored Thorez's head, killing him on the spot and leaving his bloody corpse lifeless. No public funerals will be allowed for the politician, quikly labled a terrorist, and his body will trave to his family for a private ceremony. The Interior Minister has released a public statement simply stating "The government will not comment terrorists's deaths", but more liberal elements inside parliament have expressed worries about the current somewhat unorthodox measures."

After weeks of fals reports and a Red Scare across the country, we have finally been able to arrest Thorez and weaken the jacobin party once for all.

While the republican nature of the Jacobins is public, there are no actual proofs that Thorez was organizing a plot to murder Napoleon IV, but conservatives argues that Thorez's actions were clearly leading to violent action against the monacrhy. The situation is very tangled, and the whole affair risks to turn into a political trial, with even some members of the Party of Movement fearing authoritarin tendencies inside Laval's cabinet. If judged guilty, Thorez will be convicted to at least ten years in prison, and while the punishment for treason is normally execution, the lack of concrete proofs will likely result in a reduced sentence."

The whole city of Coblence soon turned into a warzone, with members of the underground FAUD organizing workers militias to kick out our troops. Of course the so called battle only lasted two days, with us quickly defeating the rebels.

Leon Blum has gathered with what remains of the Jacobins, and together with them has organized a united leftst protest in Limoges, denouncing DeGaulle as the puppet-master of the emperor, that according to him is being manipulated by the general. Blum has given voice to a large minority of the French people which views with suspicion DeGaulle's actions, and with hima s the only leading proper opposition figure, he could gather a lot of support. A solution could be to violently suppress socialist protests, sending the gendermaries to quell possible revolts. However we could also fall back on some of our proposal, such as the education reform that we plan to pass that would teach our children to respect the emperor properly and the police reform, which would empower them further."

While this is still far away from a cult of personality, it still is a return to the image of the monarch as a divine messager in some ways. DeGaulle also plans to expand the police, establishing the gendarmeries as the true peacekeepers of the nation. The opposition has not been able to stop these reform, and now France is happly transitioning to what DeGaulle calls a more perfect emprie."

The scars of the great war have not fully healed, and many remember the horrors of the war. A massive peace movement was set up in the past weeks in Paris, and they are openly protesting with great marches in all majors French town, denouncing DeGaulle as a mad warmonger. Even the church is opposed to DeGaulle, calling him a mad atheist who figths against the people choosen by God.

In his inagural speech Maurras denounced a jewish-jacobin plot to destroy the monarchy to the consternation of jewish politician Leon Blum and many others, attacking at the same time the great business leaders of France as "friends of the liberal scum that tainst France." It is no secret that Maurras cannot stand the Parliament or the democratic system in general and that he wishes to destroy it... In the past years, Maurras plotted with the so called Duke of Paris, Henri of Orleans, the head of the only branch of the Bourbon family that remained here after the revolution; Maurras devised with him a plan to eliminate the Emperor and restore the Bourbons to the trone, in a new reactionary monarchy.

In his inagural speech Maurras denounced the existence of a Jewish-jacobin plot to destroy the French state, bragging about the guilt of big business leaders and their support for the corrupted liberal democracy. Many described Maurras's speech as the words of a senile old man, and Henriot did nothing to disprove this idea. Henriot knows that for the past months Maurras has been plotting with Henri of Orleans, the Duke of Paris, devising a plan to remove the Emperor and bring the Bourbons back to France. Henriot also thinks that a return of a reactionary monarchy is only a fever dream, and a dangerous one too, wishing instead to create a strong ultranationalist catholic state, like the one in Italy. While Maurras and Henriot start plotting against eachother and many pt their hands on their hidden knives, outside of Paris other people like general Charles DeGaulle and the radical leaders in the Rhineland are thinking about how to put an end to this new reactionary France before it is too late."

The Duke of Paris, Henri of Orleans, set face to face with Jerome Bonaparte, the far-rigth bastard nepew of the Emperor, together with many other minor nobles coming from all duchies of France and mostly with very rigthist political tendencies. But the dinner was not simply to celebrate the times of old and remember the glories of the France of the past; Maurras very softly spoke about the need for the "removal of key figures that are pushing France in the hands of jews and radicals." The nobles, mostly anti-semite, applauded and cheered at the speech, but many questioned who precisely these figures were. When Maurras said the name of "Napoleon Bonaparte," all noblemen brcame suddenly silent. The silence was interrupted by Jerome Bonaparte, who denounced Maurras for high treason against the Emperor. Maurras however started pointing out all the flaws of the current Emperor, like his trust in democracy and his calling of a new general election.

Henriot insisted on the idea that Maurras was simply an old man with old dreams, that were no longer possible to realize. Then, Henriot exposed his project of a new French state, a state that would reward loyal people and bring together all true patriots of our country, with the poor happy to serve the nobles. To Jerome, a bastard, this idea was highly appealing. Henriot knows well that the Orleanists are actually a minority among French nobles, and he has to convince the large majority of reactionary Bonapartists to realize his plans..."

Most of the key personalities of French big business were there: Louis Renault, Albert Oustric and many others. There was the noticable absence of Protestant and Jewish industrials, like André Citroen. Maurras talked a lot about the danger that the trade union movement posed to France, with the necessity of a return to traditional economy and even some nostalgy to feudalism. Maurras excessivly backwards ideas shocked many business leaders, but they know that he will likely not realize his integralist ideas, probably limiting to lift regulations and embrace a laissez-faire system. However Maurras argument didn't prove to be very convincing, and he needs more effor tto persuade the big industry leaders of the nation."

At the headquarters of "La Fraternitè", his newspaper, he met the same people which Maurras spoke with the day before. This time, however, he was alone. Henriot denounced the Prime Minister as a mad, nostalgic man, with no clear true understanding of economic matters. Henriot proposed to the business leaders to create a form of "National Syndicalism", which is just another form of corporatism. The idea of massive paramilitaries organizations hunting down strikers, sinigng patriotic songs and the elevation of business leaders to national heroes made many people present at the meeting lust. While they probably dislike the idea of being so closely monitored by the state, the prospective of controlling trade unions and workers's private lives surely was interesting."

At the same time Maurras swept away what little France had of labour protections, cancelling the rigth to strike and outlawing some labour unions. Many have called this law an out-of-season joke: most labour union have already announced massive strikes against the government, and the streets of France will be painted read soon by vclashes between the gendarmeries and the strikers.

Petain has also many, many connections within the army and the security forces, and in the worst case scenario he could secure us the support of the military against radicals and jacobins. Maurras discussed with him the many flaws of the Bonaparte dinasty, promising to start a new era of French nationalism and conservatism under the Orleanists restoration.

Henriot argues that a new nationalist state is needed, where the people rally around the idea of the nation, its spirit and its values, not simply a person with a fancy crown. Petain has been a fervent monarchist for most of his lifes, but many of Napoelon's actions made him more doubtful of his beliefes.

The Prime Minister in turn called Blum "a traitor and a conspirator", while the rest of the members of parliament stood silent in embarassment.

Some citizens even tried to form barricades in the streets, attacking everyone dressed with a uniform, but quick actions from the gendarmeries avoided further escalation.

Just today in Paris they have managed to shoot more than 10 jacobins, and the situation is even better in other parts of France! In the Rhineland the patriots are not just removing the jacobins, but also rounding up the treacherous Germans, who often supported them. Naturally some enemies of democracy don't like our policies and think we are going too far, such as Charles DeGaulle who called these actions "disgusting act of repression."

Under the now rouge general DeGaulle, some members of the army have formed the "French Libery Army", demanding the return of the Bonapartes and restoration of the Empire. And they are not the only resistence group in France: thousands of radicals, socialists and even liberals are arming and preparing to oppose the government at any time.

New from Aljaccio report that the local governor has been overthrown by revolutionaries, and the whole Africa is in caos. Many fear that DeGaulle is planning to flee to Africa and set up a Free French Government in exile. Thousands of false Frenchmen are following DeGaulle and we risk an even greater national crisis.

He has expressed the strong desire to rebuild our ties with the Church and other Catholic nations, and when asked about his plans to end the current social unrest, he answered promoting a huge boost to "national pride," with military actions and imperial tours like the one in Strasbourg. More worrying, especially for Leon Blum, was his promise to crush the enemies of the nation once and for all, including jews sympathetic to the jacobin cause. Of course both jews and jacobins are not happy with these words, and strikes are already returning to plague France."

Blum claimed that it was a barbaric institution, an echo of the old Inquisition and a mere tool of the government. Maurras was furious about this words: an evil socialist jew was criticizing him for his holy duty and was even gaining the support of parts of parliament. Some inside Action Francaise actually agree with Blum, fearing that too powerful secret police chiefs may eventually overthrow them and create a military state.

Following the growing wave of protests against Maurras's police, Napoleon has decided to hold a special speech without first discussing this possibility with the government. In a speech heard by thousands of French citizens, the Emperor has announced the end of all the activities of the secret police.

They saw the military marches in Limoges and Strasbourg as the government trying to secure its control of the more unstable areas of the country and suppressing the republican movement, which to be fair, it is not far away from the truth. Some demonstrations turned violent, and the military, which thougth to be on simple parades, was forced to fire on some armed revolutionaries in some occasions."

This piece of legislation is basically a reform of the tax system for churches, exenting all religious properties from any kind of taxation. This is not limited to churchs, but it also includes farms and fields directly or indirectly owned by the church. Another part of the law consists in the mandatory teaching of religion in all kinds of school, where children and young people will have to attend two hours a week of Catholic Religion classes. These classes will be taguth by a local priest appointed by the bishop and payd by the State, in what Maurras calls "friendly coperation between religion and secularism." While the opposition is sceptic of these ideas that may cost quite a lot on the French budget, Maurras could easily pressure the parliament to enact the law."

Monarchs have often been inconsistent, with Napoleon III mainly supporting the church, but other emperors taking a more secular stance. Maurras, thanks to his many friends inside Rome and the Vatican, has managed to organize a meeting between the Emperor and the Pope. Innocent is a very controversial figure, and a very active monarch nontheless, and the result of the meeting may depend on the amount of support the Emperor has shown for the Church here at home."

There were some very tense moments, such as when the Pope asked the emperor to knee before him as the "God's authority is superior to any king's one." The Emperor was furious, but pressure from Maurras, forced him to comply to Innocent's many anachronistic demands. The imperial visit to Rome ended with the signature of a joint declaration calling France "a nation protected by God and his delegate in Rome," a great humiliation for the Italian regime that has always tried to integrate the Pope in its own sphere of influence."

It seems like the whole imperial visit was arranged to make clear to the public that the emperor of France was a mere subservant of the Successor of Peter. Pope Innocent refused to speak any other language than latin, and never spoke personally with the Emperor, only using intermediaries. Maurras did his best to try to convince Napoleon to look content and appease the Pope, but at the end the monarch refused to sign the joint declaration that would proclaim France "a nation under the protection and caring watch of God and his most loyal servant in Rome."

Day-to-day run of the country will be in the hands of the "Royal Most Loyal Cabinet", the executive body of the Kingdom that answers only to the king and that it is composed by the one chosen directly by him. While the names of the members of cabinet have not yet been announced, it is sure that the king will flock it with the supporters of the Restoration, like Jerome Bonaparte and Philippe Petain. Elections will still be allowed with the people electing their representatives to the Estates General (the former National Assembly), but all socialist parties will be banned.

Petain has become Minister of War and Security, heading an aggressive and violent army that is still on full mobilization that often is used as a police force. With barricades being destroyed in Limoges and Paris, in the following months Petain will surely have a difficult job on his hands. Jerome Bonaparte, now Duke of the Rhine, has become Minister of the Economy and has already recieved the difficult task of overhauling the French tax system, too unfair with the great businessmen of France.

Protestants, Jews and more recently non-religious are an integral part of French society. Or at least they were until the past weeks, when Maurras in a turn of events that surprised absolutely no one decided to ban on catholics from key power position. While the law is vague and it is unlikely that it will have any practical effect, its vagueness may be used by the government to eliminate political enemies. And are these same concerns that today caused Leon Blum, a jew and leader of the DSA, to call for a general strike in Paris and other French town. This is very significant because it is the first strike called by a non jacobin political leader. Blum proclaimed to the radio that the government was emulating the authoritarian regimes of Poland, Russia and Italy, that have created antisemite ultranationalist regimes."

According to him, it is the fruit of all of his researches on atheists, jews and protestants inside the french high spheres. Some of them were the usual suspects: Blum, the remanents of the old Dreyfusards, some intellectuals and jacobins. But there were also less expected names: André Citroen, chief ofthe famous car company, accused of judaism, and even the old nobel-prize winner writer Marcel Proust, a personal enemy of Maurras for his declared homosexuality, current head of the Society of French Writers and Poets. While some think that writing a list of jews and protestants to remove them from influential positions may seem very despotic, but other arge that this is the only way to cleanse France from corruption."

I order the immediate release and restoration of freedom of thougth for all political prisoners."\nNo one would have been surprised if Leon Blum or Maurice Thorez pronounced these words. However it was the Emperor himself who spoke against Maurras today. While Napoleon's words have been broadcasted across the nation, thousands of protesters have begun marching in the streets.

Others think that a massive penal colony in Madagascar may be the perfect recipe for troubles, and suggest a trip to Reunion, an island near Madagascar already used as a penal colony, for only the wrost of criminals and agitators. A minority of former members of the Party of Order and less radical integralists think that the only thing we can do is to simply arrest the organizers of protests and strikes and slowly destroying the opposition in this way."

The mass deportation of socialist revolutionaries and dissidents to the Indian Ocean island has created precarious health conditions and constant strife between prisoners and the police forces tasked with keeping them in check. The emperor has heard from some illegal newspaper reporters that the authorities have shown little respect for the prisoners, often tasking them with cruel tasks and insulting them with racial slurs and shooting people on the spot.

Sadly there is a lack of free nobility that support the Maurras-Henri leadrship, so new nobles were created ad-hoc, to solidify the new ruling class.

This is not too far from the truth: Deat was a close friend and scolar of Geogres Sorel, the main ideologue of national syndicalism that has had a strong influence on italian ultranationalists too.

Petain suggest a massive surveilance program, with agents following and spying on people formerly associated with political parties different from the RNF. Henriot wihses to pursuit a far more radical program, which involves the use of torture and massive propraganda to reshape France in his image."

However a large number of prisoners now occupy our prisons. The Chief is not pleased by the too high cost of keeping these prisoners, but we have few alternatives to keeping them there. Some, like Petain and Jerome Bonaparte, argue for the use of prisoners in forced labour in order to create a cheap source to bolster our production. The help that those prisoners would give to our economy is questionable, but would surely help the to make our prison system cheaper. Henriot and some other radical RNP members think that we should simply periodically round them up and solve the problem of overcrowded prisoners in the easiest way possible."

Nationalist parades are held almost every other day in Paris and major French cities, with the sole scope of celbrating the nation's glory. The contstant flow of propaganda through newspapers and rafios is starting to take its toll on our citizens, that maybe tired or maybe truly convinced are starting to repeat in public squares and meeting place Henriot's message: "France first, and France alone". Jews and other minorities are regularly persecuted, with the law staying strangely silent on violnece commited against them. In Catalonia and Piedmont Spaniards and Italians are object of political discrimination and are often enocouraged to leave our borders, contributing to the massive exodus of people who every day try to flee our nation. We may have lost a great number of able workers, but the ones that have remained here are stronger and more loyal than ever."

To crush the jacobin traitors and avoid a nationalist takeover, strikes and protests have been forbidden and special military courts are putting on trial traitors to properly punish them in the follwing months. While order is being slowly restored to the nation, some inside our government have already begun to plot against us...

A sweeping piece of legislation, the act should limit radical and ultranationalist politician extraparlamentary activities, officialy banning the RNF and the Jacobins. Both parties enjoy a certain degree of popularity, and as such it would be very difficult to disband them in any time different from a military government. The gendarmeries have already recieved orders to start monitoring the most prominent trade union leaders and nationalist demagauges in France to arrest them in case the act is passed, carefully keeping the details of the law away from the public. Another key poiny of the National Defence Act is the outlawing of all paramilitary units, considered a great danger for the unity of the Empire. The law is still in a drafting phase, and the generals leading the junta are debating the final form the law."

Now we stand sourronded by enemies, and we need to create a more stable system. There are many proposals on the table, and some of the are very controversial. The most conservative generals inside our junta suggest that we should keep changes to a minimum, just preventing the most aggressive and radical parties from enetering parliament and increasing the imperial prerogatives. Other, more reactionary elements suggest putting power back in the hands of the Emperor: even if Napoleon IV is now in a very weak position, he has always been very popular among the French people and could be rebranded as a unifing figure in these time of caos. A more radical fringe part of the junta, centered around gneeral Charles DeGaulle suggest a total change of the constitution, that wishes to create a new figure that should take a lead role in French politics. According to DeGaulle, the position of President of the French Parliament should be created, replacing the Prime Minister's role with greater powers and direct two-rounds elections from the French people. Many are sceptic of DeGaulle's ideas, as the term "President" has often been associated with Republican ideas and this would cause a further loss of power for the Emperor."

Vague promises of a return to democracy have been promulgated by the government, but nobody espects these promises to be ctually fulfilled.

These traitors migth once more inspire revolution if freed, so it is clear that we have to remove them in some other ways. Many officers suggest to silently murder them in their jail, but Petain's favourite option would be a great show trial against bolsheviks and anti-bonapartist that would lead to the execution of the wrost ten traitors to the Empire.

Blum, Jouhaux and other jacobins were put on trial by a supposedly independent commission led by Petain, but it was clear that the whole affair had the sole scope of boosting the government popularity. The trial was quick and it didn't even try to appear fair, as Petain expected that the French people would have supported him. Little did he know that a large group of protesters had been organized in the past weeks and had already brougth guerilla warfare in the outskirts of Paris. In fact socialist remnants managed to march trough the city armed with whatever they could find, as police finally managed to stop them avoiding interference with the trial.

Other times, the emperor talked about the need for the upper class to take a learship role and announced new tax cuts on big French industries to destroy unemployment. This has been a very stressful task for Napoleon, as his close freinds have reported that he actually doesn't believe the content of his speeches, often written by Petain himself.

Worried about the Emperor's health, Prime Minister Petain ordered an inspection of the Emperor's private rooms in Versailles and Paris. While this is technically a violation of the Emperor's privacy and a great offense to the imperial office, but Petain made sure that no one in the press dared to repor this event. What the investigation found was shocking: a couple of cynaide pills were found in each appartment, revealing that the Emperor has been contemplating the idea of suicide! Many inside the Junta fear that the constant tours and rallies organized by the junta together with the costant control of the emperor's actions by Petain may be taking its toll Napoleon, who in the last two years often expressed regret and disgust for the junta's most despotic actions.

Napoleon has been a somewhat secular monarch, trying to don't mix religious authority with political one, but now many bishops and priests have offered their support for the government. We could raise the status of the catholic church in our nation, granting them special priviligies in exchange of support, but we have to remember that not all French are catholic, and some are not even christian like the many jews and the muslims that have come from Algeria."

While most politician recognize the need of obeying to the rules of the League, some warhawks and nationalists believe that we should put the strength of France first and foremost, ignoring international laws if they openly go against our own interests.

For this reason, Admiral Darlan has proposed a new revolutionary strategy, that will put focus away from the French Grand fleet. Seeing the Atlantic theatre as a waste of resources, Darlan calls for better trade protection and new fortifications to prevent another Calais.

Luxembourg has been for decades a contested region and a source of dissent between Germans and French, with the former fearing French influence in German lands.

The socislists's demand appear to be not too outrageous, given the fact that Lerroux is a moderate centrist and would probably not overthrow the kingdom.

However the few weeks appear to have been among Spain's darkest days; following king Alfonso's decision of accepting French demands and ceding the Balearic Isalnds to Paris, the far rigth has taken up arms and Jose Primo de Rivera has publicaly called the King a French puppet and a weak leader. In a few weeks militia units were armed in the North, and a large part of the army defected to the falangists too. But this is not where Spain's troubles end: republican sympatizers are organizing themselves, seeing this an opportunity to force the King to adopt liberal reform and create a republic (or more realisticly a constitutional monarchy)."

Now that Spain is once more on its feet, Primo de Rivera has already begun to draw plans to achieve what he promised when he first rised up: take back Spain's honour. We are still too weak for a confrontation against the French, and many argue that we should join the Commonwealth and the British in their anti-French crusade.

This suspicions are without fundation, and are simply the product of paranoia and lack of unity among the various leftist factions of the republic, but the PSOE has already proposed a motion of no confidence against the president, hoping to form a new jacobin government led by Dolores Ibaurri "La Pasionaira."

 deluge_france407desc: "It may seem strange, but the duke of Kalergi have seemed to been able to fun tens of Paneuropa societies across the whole continent. In Italy, Austria and Spain enlightened gentlement meet in this cricles, discussing the dream of a united Europe. These people are doing their best to support our project, organizing rallies and publicizing the Continental Union project. The Duke's plan however has proven far less succesful in the rural countryside of European countries, as farmers seem less intreested in the prospect of a multinational body directing eache country's policies, seeing this vision as too abstract or as another tool for the powerful of the world to control them. While the Paneuropean project is still very controversial and many look at him with scepticism, we are gaining support and sooner or later we'll win."

 deluge_france408title: "Future of the Continent"
 deluge_france408desc: "With French society polarizing on the topic of Continental integration, we have to decide what the future of the Continental Coal and Steel Community will be. With people like Monnet and the Duke of Kalergi, together with politicians like Shuman, endorsing a true Paneuropean project opposing nationalist and conservative politicians, the Emperor will once again be the true authority on the future of europe. The CCSC could profit us much more if we decided to turn it into a tool for our interests, but idealistic (and maybe naive) politicians will be very angry at this percieved backstab of the European ideal."

 deluge_france410title: "France centralizes the CCSC"
 deluge_france410desc: "Winds of change sweep across Europe. The French Empire has announced its desire to empower the CCSC, centralizing it and democraticizing it. While many in our country fear this quick turn of events, being a member of the CCSC now will allow us far more control and influence in European affairs, and the power of the Continental System (now many call it the Continental Union however) will only grow in the future."

 deluge_france411title: "A Continental Parliament"
 deluge_france411desc: "France has begun to build a Continental Parliament in Luxembourg, which will host representatives from all nations inside the Continental System. The Continental Parliament will have the power to draft and approve laws that will later pass through the Continental Coal and Steel Commission, with the latter having the power to veto it and send it back to the parliament for amendments. Legislative initiative is shared between the parliament and the commission, trying to preserve the balance among the different countries. While many are scared of this powerful institution, maybe it will bring needed changes to the Continental System and renew Europe poisition across the globe."

 deluge_france412title: "Building the Continental Union"
 deluge_france412desc: "As works continue in the construction of the Luxembourg Parliament, we need to draft the constitution of the Continental Union, the body that the parliament will rule. The Continental Union will be a supernational confederation, composed of all the members states that have agreed to join the Continental System. power is shared between the states and the elected parliament, directed by the president. The nations will exercise their powers through the CCSC commission, which will be renamed to a more general and less economic-aimed Continental Commission; the commission and the parliament share legislative initiative, and have both the power to veto and amend each-other proposal. While this framework is very complicated and slow, it is the only one that could logically work in bringing together so much different entities, and even in this case it will be a challange to preserve our union."

 deluge_france413title: "The birth of the Continental Union"
 deluge_france413desc: "The last year was marked with a lot of political fervor across Europe. Under the leadership of the French Empire, countries from the Continental System have formed the Continental Union, a confederal entity whith an elected parliament sitting in Luxembourg. Critics say that the Union is not democratic enough or that it will destroy the indentity of the member nations, and the dream of European Unity surely seems naive; however in the past centuries many dreamt about a united continent, and this may be the best attempt at it."

 deluge_france414title: "The Federalization of the Continental Union"
 deluge_france414desc: "In the next months we will complete the Federalization of the Continental Union. As war rages against us, the government and the CU parliament have painted the current conflict as a clash of civilization, erecting the Continental way of life as the beacon of peace and democracy across the world. In the coming decades we will have to deal with the effect of this massive endevour, but for now at least, the Continental dream stands strong."

The French have officialy announced their membership inside a new federal entity, the Continental Union, with a capital in Luxembourg where the Continental Parliament already sits and writes laws and decrees. National parliaments will be demoted, and while the new federation will be heavily decentralized, the Luxembourgish Parliament will be able to overule their decision and will be the only one to be able to set the budget of the whole federation. Now, it is time to decide what our future will be"

 deluge_france418desc: "As the Continental Union has finally been centralized, it is time for the people of Europe to elect their first president. The election is direct and happens simultanuesly with the Continental Parliament one, and is organized in two rounds. The center-rigth Chirstian Democratic party is the clear favorite winner of the election, under the leadership of French politician and father of Europe Robert Shuman. However, Shuman is not so popular away from France, and many leftists have argued that a non-French president could reinforce the idea that the Continental Union is more than an enlarged French Empire. These people have rallied around italian socialist Altiero Spinelli, chairman of the Pan-European Social-Labourist Party who fled to France after Mussolini's rise to power. Spinelli is a radical leftist, but recently he has become more moderate and his popularity in Pan-European circles have made him a palatable option for more people.

A small French fleet is heading toards Ireland, their new formal ally, and we fear that these may be preparations for an invasion of the British islands in the future. As Ireland is a sovreign nation, we cannot force them to leave the Continental System, but some inside our war cabinet suggest a raid on the French fleet in the Channel hoping to stop them and prevent another bloody war."

While few ships were actually damaged, this is an unprecedented attack on French sovreignity. While it may be true that we overextended in British territorial waters, refusing to go to war with the British may be seen as a sign of cowardice, and may spark a domino effect across Europe, strengthening our enemies' claims."

Tensions between France and England were reignited when the contested Republic of Ireland decided to formally become a part of the Continental System, causing French troops and ships to move towards the island to establish a military presence.\nThe British saw this as an act of aggression, and answered ordering a raid on the approaching French fleet. Angry, the French responded with a declaration of war, and now convoys are sinking across the Atlantic, while soldiers die in India, Ireland, the Far East and all across the world. Two titans are clashing."

They have demanded the complete cancellation of all our territorial claims and a return to the post-Great War political situation. This is of course impossible and a clear exxcuse to go to war against our great nation.

In the Great War, thanks to us, the Spanish were able to aquire Egypt and Gibraltar, and while they have fulfilled most of their ambitions, they could forge an alliance with us in exchange for Catalonia. Portugal instead is experiencing a tense relation with Britain, facing conflicting claims in India and Africa, and may greatly benefit from our protection."

Portugal has traditionally been neutral in European affairs, and this turn of events has resparked tensions between Spain and Portugal. While Spain and us were never on the best terms and even fougth during the Great War, we share distrust of the French and an alliance may be formed between us. We will recognize their new possessions of Gibraltar and Ceylon, relinquishing our claims, in exchange for mutual asssitance in war."

Reminding us of our succesful anti-British campaign in the Great War, the French have proposed to forge a new alliance, securing their western position in the continent. This however is heavily contested, given the fact that the French still hold control of Catalonia, a region with a strong Spanish presence that was stolen from us during the Napoleonic Wars. This time we could trade our alliance with the return of Catalonia and full control of the Suez Canal, which the French took for themselves during the last war."

While this issue is controversial, most people inside the government agreee that an Iberian alliance is very important if we want to dominate European affair. However, agreeing to Spanish demands would both anger nationalists at home and scare the Portugese that we are coming for them."

In response to this, our foreign minister suggests that we should approach the Portugese, renewing our ancient alliance in exchange for relinquishing all our claims on their Indian lands. While this will cost us some prestige, it is very important to counter French influence in Europe in this troubling time."

However, today other enemies look with greed and anger at our two great empires; a revanchist Russian Empire looks at the border nations of Europe ready to invade them, while an ultranationalist poland prepares its armies to rage once more war in Europe. In the far east, the Japanese Empire prepares to attack English and French territories in the Pacific while a once more strong China wants to take back its treaty ports. Here in Europe, the British and French governments are both controlled by moderate and pacifist forces, that could join forces in order to defend our Empires from outside enemies.\n\nThe Foreign Minister has proposed a radical and controversial change in international politics, that could upset the balance of power in the world forever. Proposing a mutual-defence pact with the British, and promising to come to their aid in case of a defensive war against another nation. While an outrigth alliance would be very difficult to achieve, this may be the first step in a new age of Franco-British cooperation."

Countless men have lost their lives under our two banners, and for this reason the proposal presented from the French Prime Minister [FRA.GetLeader] seems very radical and almost unbelievable. He presented examples of dangerous revanchist powers that would backsktab and attack both of our great empires, and as such has proposed a mutual defence treaty between us. This treaty would make war among us impossible, and put us on the same side in case of foreign aggresssion. This however would also mean renouncing all our claims on French territories."

 deluge_puppets1desc: "Huge differences have emerged between the ruling [Root.GetRulingParty] and the ideology of our master. [Root.GetLeader]'s government was established in a much different atmosphere and the changes in thought have not permeated down to us yet. Should we resolve our differences with the imperial core or seek to break free and stay true to our ideals?"
 deluge_puppets1opta: "The [Root.GetRulingParty] are in the right. Our oppressor must recognise our independence."
 deluge_puppets1optb: "We can't hope to wage a war against them. We must adhere to their new ideology."
 deluge_puppets1optc: "The status quo will work just fine, thanks."

 deluge_puppets2desc: "The strain from the huge differences that have emerged between our former puppet's ruling [From.GetRulingParty] government and that of [Root.GetLeader] has reached breaking point. [From.GetLeader]'s puppet state was established in a much different atmosphere and the changes in thought we have brought to [Root.GetNameDef] have not permeated down to them yet.\n\nNow, the puppet's [From.GetRulingParty] traitors have declared that they are 'staying true to their ideals' and have demanded we recognise their independence!"
 deluge_puppets2opta: "The [From.GetAdjective] leadership are traitors and rebels. We need to put them back in their place."
 deluge_puppets2optb: "We must go our separate ways in peace."

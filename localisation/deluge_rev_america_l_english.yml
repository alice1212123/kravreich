When George Washington was elevated to the title of George I, America appeared as the beacon of progress and liberal capitalism in the whole world; it provided refuge to European migrants seeking refuge from countless wars, but the situation now is vastly different. The American tradition of frequently elevating new nobles among the most brilliant citizens of the country has contributed to the creation of a ruling class of burgeoise-nobles, a small circle which runs the government, has a near monopoly on key industries and has a strong influence on King John. Inequality is sharply rising, and the whole house of cards came crushing down with the Great Depression and the collpase of the Westphalian Central Bank; unemployement has skyrocketed, and the government, led by Prime Minister Joseph Kennedy (recently appointed Duke of New Bruniswick) is paralyzed by the continuos requests of the nobles. With the news of continued violence in Europe, maybe the King himself should intervene to address the situation..."

  deluge_america2desc: "In the Kingdom of America there are four major parties, all holding legal status and representation in COngress in Philadelphia. The oldest party is the Federalist Party, founded by Alexander Hamilton to support King John and his central government before he himself was crowned as king Alexander I. Now the Federalist Part is the main tool of the King's inner circle and the nobility0s interests. It promotes an unregulated version of capitalism and an armonization of laws across America\n\nThe second biggest party in America is the Whigh party, originally founded by Thomas Jefferson to oppose Federalist's power as the Democratic-Republican party. While the Whigh was a radical jacobin party in the past, it has now adopted a more moderate stance. After electoral defeat in 1932, it enetered a state of deep crisis and is currently leaderless and plagued by factionalism among a social-democratic wing led by aging Franklin Delano Roosevelt and a more centrist one, led by Robert F. Wagner.\n\nThen there is the Democratic Party, founded by former Prime Minister Andrew Jackson (later impeached for tyranny and attempted usurption). The Democrats are a radical nationalist party, which opposes black emancipation and has deep ties with the KKK and racial supremacist. It managed to emerge to the national stage thanks to its new leader, Huey Long, and his populist and more inclusive policies which llok acceptable to even some northeners.\n\nFinally there is the black horse, the Republican Party. Founded by radical abolitionists in the 1880s, it has developed into a socialist uninized party, which fights to destroy business monopolies and has its main support base in urban areas and industrial workers. It is led by Great War veteran Smedley Butler. Butler is very popular among disillusioned veterans, and aristocrats whisper that he may even bring revolution to America with a buttle if needed..."

For the first time since the 1880s, no party held a majority in Congress; serving Whigh Prime Minister Warren G. Harding called for immediate dissolution of Congress, but King John and his inner circle forced a grand coalition between Whighs and Federalists under federalist chairman Joseph P. Kennedy. The grand coalition has been plagued by Harding's corruption and any attempt of reform by Kennedy has been defeated by the King, who is using more than ever his veto powers to preserve the quickly collapsing status quo. To make the situation even worse, the Whighs are in the midst of a deep political crisis: Congressman Henry Wallace is rallying a group of progressive Whighs, including influencial senator Franklin Delan Roosevelt and Burton K. Wheeler, to split from the Whigh party and support center-left reforms. At the same time, more and more federalists like Fielding L.

Stedman authorized a strike of the local Ford car workers, even though the right to strike is not guaranteed at the federal level. Today Count Stevenson personally asked King John to order federal troops to quell the strike, a thing John II promptly did, without consulting with the Prime Minister. The Chicago strikers, peraohs not knowing the strike had been cancelled by federal authorities, began throwing rocks against the federal policemen; soon the rocks became metal pieces, and them someone in the crowd shot a policeman in the leg.

Byrd has always been secretly impressed by Long's capability to turn the Democratic Party in such a massive beast, and it is speculated that he wish to see Long's ideals adopted in the whole South.

The Whighs have de fact left the grand coalition, and they overrule evey one of the Prime Minister's vetos. Government is only functional thanks to Long's lobying and the King's powers, but it is clear democracy in America is broken.

Butler's reforms have been mostly superficial, and we need to quicklt decide if we want to transform the Continental Army into a true professional army, with established officer roles, a strong hierarchical structure and a rigid organization. This would strengthen the powers of the Commander in Chief, as his direct control of the army would increase fastening the planning process. Wallace's faction strongly supports this idea, believing that it would increase American legitimacy turning the Republic into a true modern state with legal institutions and proper organization. The radical jacobins instead propose a far different approach, creating a people's army made mainly of drafted workers and employing an elected structure with soldiers directly electing their officers under the supervision of political commissars, appointed by the Government who would control the electotal process assuring quick elections and avoiding desertions. Cannon is the only proponent of this idea, which is considered dangerous by Browder and most other Congess leader. However Butler's own opinions may be enough to swin Congress's vote."

Afircan America have offficialy the same legal status of White Americans, and every kind of discrimination has been banned by Congress. [USA.GetLeader] has declared this to be a historic day for America, as the dream of the Founding Fathers has finally been fulfilled. In 1865, Thaddeus Stevens founded the Republican Party with the precise aim of abolishing the institution of slavery and the wicked monarchy that allowed Souther racism.

Wallace agrees with this idea, and has proposed that regular tribunals should handle this issues, putting on trial supposed traitors and sentencing them on the account of regular law. Browder, the eternal compormiser, simply wishes to kick down the road this issue, putting suspected traitors in jail and deciding about their fate after the Revolution is truly completed.\n\nCannon is disgusted at such burgoise proposals, and demands complete revolutionary justice, with Revolutionary tribunals deciding the fate of burgoise oligarchs as well as immediately confiscating their wealth."

Browder's proposal shocked many, and even jacobin Cannon has stated that it would be best to wait until the revolution is over to take such drasting decisions, as the South must be first converted into a true socialist society via mass industrialization.\n\nRepublican chairman Thomas instead has put forward strong ethical arguments against Browder's proposal: his aim of collapsing the Dixie Army by punishing the civilian population is comparable to a war crime in his opinion, and our efforts should be focused on spreading propaganda among our black comrades."

The only site spared from the flames was St. John's Church for its historical relevance, as it was the location of Patrick Henry's famous speach "Give me liberty or give me death."

 deluge_abstain: "Abstain from this vote."
 deluge_league1title: "League of Nations Invites Members"
 deluge_league1desc: "At the conclusion of the Great War, [From.GetNameDef] began a project to ensure peace and stability across Europe and the world. The League of Nations today issued its Covenant and invited other nations to sign it:\n'In order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, the Contracting Parties agree to this Covenant of the League of Nations...'"
 deluge_league1opta: "Is this some kind of bourgeois trick?"
 deluge_league1optb: "A worthy endeavour!"
 deluge_league1optc: "A noble endeavour!"
 deluge_league1optd: "In this world of eternal struggle?"
 deluge_league2title: "Join the League of Nations?"
 deluge_league2desc: "We have been asked by officials of the League of Nations to appoint delegates to their conference in Geneva. We will be entitled to vote on all proposed Conventions, with the expectation that we will at some point ratify and implement the legislation produced by the international community. The intention of the League is to prevent further outbreaks of warfare by giving nations a space to settle their differences."
 deluge_league2opta: "Accept."
 deluge_league2optb: "Refuse."
 deluge_league3title: "International Court of Justice Proposed"
 deluge_league3desc: "The main function of the League of Nations is to resolve international disputes before they can descend into war. The International Court of Justice would be the main instrument to fulfil this goal. Judges will be elected by League of Nations member states to arbitrate over disputes, with the power to issue binding resolutions and award compensation to plaintiffs.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, it will be much more difficult to create casus belli, both for us and our enemies."
 deluge_league3opta: "But what will the class character of the law be?"
 deluge_league3optb: "Jurisprudence protects mankind from barbarism."
 deluge_league3optc: "The laws of men are subservient to God, but they are useful nonetheless."
 deluge_league3optd: "Legal mumbo jumbo to protect the weak from real justice."
 deluge_league4title: "The International Court of Justice"
 deluge_league4desc: "We now have the opportunity to vote on the proposed International Court of Justice.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, it will be much more difficult to create casus belli, both for us and our enemies."
 deluge_league6title: "International Court of Justice Passes"
 deluge_league6desc: "The League of Nations has voted to create a permanent court with jurisdiction over all member states. Nations may now forward their cases to the body of elected judges, who will arbitrate disputes and thus prevent them escalating into war."
 deluge_league6opta: "But what will the class character of the law be?"
 deluge_league6optb: "Jurisprudence protects mankind from barbarism."
 deluge_league6optc: "The laws of men are subservient to God, but they are useful nonetheless."
 deluge_league6optd: "Legal mumbo jumbo to protect the weak from real justice."
 deluge_league7title: "International Court of Justice Fails"
 deluge_league7desc: "The proposal in the League of Nations to create a permanent court with jurisdiction over all member states has failed. With no way to arbitrate disputes between nations, the League of Nations now looks much less likely to prevent future wars."
 deluge_league7opta: "The bourgeoisie would never have obeyed the resolutions."
 deluge_league7optb: "This is a travesty!"
 deluge_league7optc: "At least the majesty of the sovereign will not be infringed upon."
 deluge_league7optd: "Justice is taken, not given."
 deluge_league8title: "International Relief Union Proposed"
 deluge_league8desc: "The International Red Cross has approached the League of Nations with a request to create an organisation that will respond to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, famines and floods. The body would distribute food, clothes, and medicine, and help with reconstruction efforts.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, we will have to devote a small amount of domestic industry to foreign aid, but we will have an easier time justifying huminatarian interventions."
 deluge_league8opta: "Is this for the wellbeing of the people, or to put a finger in every pie?"
 deluge_league8optb: "This could be a very humane programme."
 deluge_league8optc: "Noblesse oblige on a grand scale."
 deluge_league8optd: "Surely our own people should come first."
 deluge_league9title: "The International Relief Union"
 deluge_league9desc: "We can now vote on the proposal to create a disaster relief organisation.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, we will have to devote a small amount of domestic industry to foreign aid, but we will have an easier time justifying huminatarian interventions."
 deluge_league11title: "International Relief Union Passes"
 deluge_league11desc: "The League of Nations has voted to create a disaster relief organisation. It will respond to natural disasters such as earthquakes, famines and floods by distributing food, clothes and medicine, and by helping in recosntruction efforts."
 deluge_league11opta: "Is this for the wellbeing of the people, or to put a finger in every pie?"
 deluge_league11optb: "This could be a very humane programme."
 deluge_league11optc: "Noblesse oblige on a grand scale."
 deluge_league11optd: "Surely our own people should come first."
 deluge_league12title: "International Relief Union Fails"
 deluge_league12desc: "The proposal to create a disaster relief organisation has failed. It encountered significant opposition, especially from the Anglosphere and supporters of laissez-faire economics."
 deluge_league12opta: "The bourgeoisie despise being told how to spend their money."
 deluge_league12optb: "It was probably too utopian a proposal to succeed."
 deluge_league12optc: "One supposes that charity must begin at home."
 deluge_league12optd: "Why should we pay for other countries' mistakes?"
 deluge_league13title: "Prohibition on Poison Gas Proposed"
 deluge_league13desc: "The old Hague Conventions of the 1890s were flagrantly broken by all the belligerents during the Great War. The use of poison gas artillery shells was especially barbaric. The League of Nations has received a proposal to ban the use of poisonous and asphyxiating gases in warfare.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, we will have a good excuse to save money on gas masks, which all but the most conservative Generals agree are not going to be needed in future wars."
 deluge_league13opta: "Mechanised slaughter is a product of late stage capitalism."
 deluge_league13optb: "We must never again unleash that terror upon civilisation."
 deluge_league13optc: "It was a most ignoble way to die."
 deluge_league13optd: "Any means are justified to protect the nation."
 deluge_league14title: "The Prohibition on Poison Gas"
 deluge_league14desc: "We can now vote on the proposal to ban the use of poison gas in warfare.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, we will have a good excuse to save money on gas masks, which all but the most conservative Generals agree are not going to be needed in future wars."
 deluge_league16title: "Prohibition on Poison Gas Passes"
 deluge_league16desc: "The League of Nations has formally banned the use of poisonous and asphyxiating gases in warfare. Though banned by the old Hague Conventions, many belligerents chose to deploy these horrific weapons in the recent Great War. Now humanity has again demanded that these terror weapons be kept sheathed."
 deluge_league16opta: "Mechanised slaughter is a product of late stage capitalism."
 deluge_league16optb: "We must never again unleash that terror upon civilisation."
 deluge_league16optc: "It was a most ignoble way to die."
 deluge_league16optd: "Any means are justified to protect the nation."
 deluge_league17title: "Prohibition on Poison Gas Fails"
 deluge_league17desc: "The proposal to formally ban the use of poisonous and asphyxiating gases in warfare has failed. The new League of Nations has been unable to persuade its member states of the need to update the old Hague Conventions. The world hopes that these terror weapons are kept sheathed regardless."
 deluge_league17opta: "Kings do not care if peasants and workers die in agony."
 deluge_league17optb: "This is a disaster!"
 deluge_league17optc: "Most unsettling, but we will remain vigilant."
 deluge_league17optd: "Any means are justified to protect the nation."
 deluge_league18title: "Convention on Prisoners of War Proposed"
 deluge_league18desc: "The old Hague Conventions of the 1890s dealt with the rules of war. Soldiers in uniform were afforded basic dignities, and arbitrary executions banned. A proposal has been made to the League of Nations to reiterate these rules and give them the weight of law.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, there will be very slight increases in the cost of making war, but our troops will be less brutalised."
 deluge_league18opta: "The strain of war has always fallen most heavily on the conscripted soldier."
 deluge_league18optb: "There can be rules in war. It is not a contradiction."
 deluge_league18optc: "Capturing one's opponent was always the most noble outcome in battle."
 deluge_league18optd: "Is a soldier who surrenders of any use to anyone?"
 deluge_league19title: "The Convention on Prisoners of War"
 deluge_league19desc: "We now have the opportunity to vote on the proposal to guarantee captured soldiers some basic dignities.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, there will be very slight increases in the cost of making war, but our troops will be less brutalised."
 deluge_league21title: "Convention on Prisoners of War Passes"
 deluge_league21desc: "Member states of the League of Nations have reiterated the old Hague Conventions on the treatment of captured soldiers. Any uniformed combatant who surrenders is now expected to be fed, clothed and cared for while in captivity."
 deluge_league21opta: "The strain of war has always fallen most heavily on the conscripted soldier."
 deluge_league21optb: "There can be rules in war. It is not a contradiction."
 deluge_league21optc: "Capturing one's opponent was always the most noble outcome in battle."
 deluge_league21optd: "Is a soldier who surrenders of any use to anyone?"
 deluge_league22title: "Convention on Prisoners of War Fails"
 deluge_league22desc: "Member states of the League of Nations have been unable to come to an agreement on the treatment of captured soldiers. While the old Hague Conventions on the matter were largely respected during the Great War, the failure of the League of Nations to reiterate these basic rules of war is very disappointing to most onlookers."
 deluge_league22opta: "Well, if the kings refuse to play fair, we cannot be expected to hobble ourselves."
 deluge_league22optb: "Hopefully, future belligerents will respect their prisoners regardless."
 deluge_league22optc: "Perhaps capture is only fit for knights and nobles, peasants cannot pay ransom."
 deluge_league22optd: "Our hands will not be tied by the moralising of weaklings."
 deluge_league23title: "Maritime Protections Convention Proposed"
 deluge_league23desc: "In the Age of Sail, boarding and capture of merchant vessels was common. With the advent of aircraft and submarines, it is less likely. Even so, a proposal to the League of Nations has been made that unarmed merchant ships should be given the opportunity by attackers to board lifeboats before being sunk, and the sailors given food and water where possible to preserve lives. Signatories will also have the responsibility to avoid attacking designated hospital ships.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, our attacks on convoys will be less successful, but we will be a more desirable trade partner for nations risking the seas."
 deluge_league23opta: "It may be necessary to wage war by any means."
 deluge_league23optb: "Striking at the defenceless is abhorrent."
 deluge_league23optc: "Ah, Hornblower and Nelson, such splendid stories!"
 deluge_league23optd: "If our enemies seek to starve us out, we will respond in kind."
 deluge_league24title: "The Maritime Protections Convention"
 deluge_league24desc: "We can now vote to restrict attacks on merchant shipping in order to preserve the lives of crew and the safety of hospital ships, where possible.\n\nIf we ratify this Convention, our attacks on convoys will be less successful, but we will be a more desirable trade partner for nations risking the seas."
 deluge_league26title: "Maritime Protections Convention Passes"
 deluge_league26desc: "The League of Nations has voted to restrict attacks on merchant shipping in limited ways. Signatories are now responsible for avoiding attacks on hospital ships, and crews are to be given time to board lifeboats with food and water before their vessel is destroyed."
 deluge_league26opta: "It may be necessary to wage war by any means."
 deluge_league26optb: "Striking at the defenceless is abhorrent."
 deluge_league26optc: "Ah, Hornblower and Nelson, such splendid stories!"
 deluge_league26optd: "If our enemies seek to starve us out, we will respond in kind."
 deluge_league27title: "Maritime Protections Convention Fails"
 deluge_league27desc: "The League of Nations has rejected proposals to limit attacks on merchant shipping. The old customs are beginning to die out with more advanced technologies. Unrestricted submarine warfare looks increasingly likely in the future."
 deluge_league27opta: "It may be necessary to wage war by any means."
 deluge_league27optb: "Striking at the defenceless is abhorrent."
 deluge_league27optc: "One supposes that prizes and boarding actions are a thing of the past."
 deluge_league27optd: "If our enemies seek to starve us out, we will respond in kind."
 deluge_league28title: "League of Nations: [From.GetAdjective] Entry"
 deluge_league28desc: "Domestic legislation passed by the ruling [From.GetRulingParty] has been met with praise by League of Nations officials. [From.GetLeader] has announced that [From.GetNameDef] is now fully compliant with all conventions passed by the international community."
 deluge_league28opta: "Peace in our time!"
 deluge_league28optb: "Very good."
 deluge_league28optc: "The League of Nations is irrelevant to our troubles."
 deluge_league29title: "League of Nations: [From.GetAdjective] Withdrawal"
 deluge_league29desc: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that [From.GetNameDef] is unable to meet the commitments imposed by the League of Nations. The country will no longer participate in votes or elections and rejects all authority and jurisdiction of the League."
 deluge_league29opta: "Independence!"
 deluge_league29optb: "Concerning."
 deluge_league29optc: "The League of Nations is irrelevant to our troubles."
 deluge_league30title: "Disband the League of Nations?"
 deluge_league30desc: "With our occupation of the Swiss city of Geneva, we are faced with what to do with the many citizens of neutral and hostile countries who work for the League of Nations, and of course the delegates sent to the Assembly to vote on legislation. To allow these workers and delegates to stay in our territory invites espionage and intrigue, so we would need to closely police the activities of the League if we want it to continue to exist. On the other hand, we could simply send the delegates of neutral countries home, arrest any citizens of enemy nations, and dismantle the League organisations headquartered in Geneva."
 deluge_league30opta: "Storm the League buildings and arrest the spies!"
 deluge_league30optb: "This experiment in diplomacy must be kept alive."
 deluge_league31title: "League of Nations Disbanded"
 deluge_league31desc: "[From.GetAdjective] troops have entered the Swiss city of Geneva and have stormed the Assembly building of the League of Nations. Delegates of countries hostile to [From.GetNameDef] have been arrested, while neutral citizens have been interned pending deportation. Organisations associated with the League have ceased to function and it is unlikely the international community will create another peace-minded body any time soon."
 deluge_league31opta: "It was necessary to ensure the security of [From.GetAdjective] personnel."
 deluge_league31optb: "The international bourgeoisie were never truly interested in talk."
 deluge_league31optc: "The international community will not stand for this flagrant violation!"
 deluge_league31optd: "A shame, that noble project showed such promise."
 deluge_league31opte: "Only strength ensures survival. Cowards can no longer hide behind words."
 deluge_league32title: "Economic Assistance Programme"
 deluge_league32desc: "The League of Nations will be a fine diplomatic tool for achieving peace across the world, but it is not the only tool available to us. We can help bring the nations of the world closer together with an Economic Assistance Programme for co-ordinating responses to tax evasion, smuggling, recessions, trade disputes and other financial and economic issues. Customs nomenclature will be standardised and statistical and analytical tools developed.\n\nTogether, these measures will hopefully result in closer integration of the world economy and faster exchange of new ideas in electronics and industry. Thus, there will never be a second Great War, as the nations of the world will have too much to lose."
 deluge_league33title: "Economic Assistance Programme"
 deluge_league33desc: "The League of Nations is a mostly diplomatic tool for achieving peace across the world, but it is not the only tool available to us. [From.GetLeader] has expressed a desire to help bring the nations of the world closer together with an Economic Assistance Programme for co-ordinating responses to tax evasion, smuggling, recessions, trade disputes and other financial and economic issues. Customs nomenclature will be standardised and statistical and analytical tools developed.\n\nTogether, these measures will hopefully result in closer integration of the world economy and faster exchange of new ideas in electronics and industry. Thus, there will never be a second Great War, as the nations of the world will have too much to lose."
 deluge_league34title: "League of Nations Progress"
 deluge_league34desc: "Civil rights activists in [Root.GetNameDef] have criticised [Root.GetLeader]'s government for a perceived lack of progress in ratifying the League of Nations Conventions we committed ourselves to adopting some time ago. While this is hardly a threat to our legitimacy, it is an annoyance. Diplomats in Geneva are encouraging our legislators to consider ratifying the internationally-agreed obligations as soon as possible."
 deluge_league34opta: "Of course, our word is our bond."
 deluge_league34optb: "We will never adopt their ridiculous 'Conventions'."
 deluge_league34optc: "The ongoing war prevents us from spending any time on such matters."

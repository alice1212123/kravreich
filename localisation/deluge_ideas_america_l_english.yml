  american_aristocracy_desc: "America's political elites have enjoyed the luxury of European women especially with France. The result of such mingiling is an unoffical form of nobles who loyalties lie with a more monarchist way of thinking and ruling. America is by no stretch of the imagination a kingdom, but to say there aren't those who desire it to be one would be a grave misinterpretation of the American mindset."

  cult_of_washington_desc: "When Washington was killed by an English redcoat at the battle of Kings Mountain the founding fathers were left to their own devices. Knowing of Washingtons wishes for a republic the founding fathers did as he wished with their own twist to ensure Americas survival in this monarchist dominated world. An Oligarchical Republic is was America is, "Officialy", though others would say a kingdom or even an Empire with the Washington lineage as its royal family."
  the_free_mans_King_desc: "Compared to his previous fellow American leaders Mr Wallace is far more Libertarian in his views, upsetting a great portion of the nations wealthy elites and active politicians. He seeks to expand suffrage to a greater part of the population, and bring about a true republic to the Commonwealth; even if it could cost him his life. Three years into his second term as President, he has introduced numerous economic and political reforms, that have nearly cost him his head on more than one occasion. Assassination attempts are around every corner for Mr Wallace, and it is surprising that this "Free Mans King" is still walking and talking."

 deluge_china1desc: "We must not stand alone when the time comes to smash the northern heathens and unite China. We need to seek out military allies.

The ports were quickly occupied by nearby garrisons, with local businessmen, colonial administrators and officers' families fleeing en masse in French ships.\n\nThe Unequal Treaties ceded partial sovereignty over the ports during a period of internal instability in China, and the presence of European empires in China has long been a sore point for Chinese nationalists."

His early death could spell a return to crisis in China, or else cement our status as a modernised Great Power, depending upon the choices in the days ahead.\n\nThe party Central Committee must now select a successor.

 japanese_expansion4desc: "Over the past few months, revanchist rhetoric has been increasing in [From.GetNameDef], with Russia the target of [From.GetLeader]'s ire. The [From.GetAdjective] government has issued a statement declaring her armies will begin 'seizing back' lands in Siberia illegally held by Russia if they do not withdraw.

 japanese_diplomacy10title: "Military Coup"
 japanese_diplomacy10desc: "Several thousand ideologically driven young officers and soldiers have seized key government buildings and are attempting to arrest cabinet ministers and advisors opposed to them.

 japanese_diplomacy11title: "Japanese Ultranationalists"
 japanese_diplomacy11desc: "The far-right faction have seized power in Japan following a brief period of civil unrest in which several hundred government ministers and moderate army officers were arrested. The unrest ended when the Emperor intervened by commending the 'League of Blood' for their initiative. War Minister Hideki Tojo has been appointed Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nJapan appears to be entering an expansionist and revanchist phase."

 japanese_diplomacy13title: "Defeat In China"
 japanese_diplomacy13desc: "We have been pushed out of mainland China. We have lost territory from Korea to Haishenwei, and the Chinese still control their capital and coastline. Rather than drag the war on longer and risk further defeats and possible revolution in the home islands, we may wish to offer concessions to China in exchange for peace.\n\nOur intelligence apparatus has informed us that political extremists stand ready to exploit news of our defeats. We should turn inwards and deal with our domestic troubles."
 japanese_diplomacy13opta: "We lost. We must withdraw from China."
 japanese_diplomacy13optb: "We can still win this. Crush any rebels and retake Manchuria!"
 japanese_diplomacy14title: "Japan Admits Defeat"

 japanese_diplomacy15title: "Japan Cedes Manchuria"

 japanese_diplomacy17optb: "Bastards!"
 japanese_diplomacy17optc: "To victory!"
 japanese_diplomacy18title: "Chinese Self-Strengthening"
 japanese_diplomacy18desc: "It seems that [From.GetLeader] is urging the [From.GetRulingParty] to rapidly modernise [From.GetAdjective] society in preparation for some great undertaking. Little imagination is needed to see that this will lead to a future Sino-Japanese war over our possessions in Manchuria. The question for us now is whether we should force another Manchurian war before the Chinese are ready. We seized the East in 1930, and it is unlikely the Chinese troops are much better today."
 japanese_diplomacy18opta: "China must give us a larger buffer zone in Manchuria."
 japanese_diplomacy18optb: "We aren't yet ready for another war with China."
 japanese_diplomacy19title: "Japan Demands Manchuria"
 japanese_diplomacy19desc: "The Japanese have noted our attempts to modernise Chinese society and feel threatened. They have issued us with a demand to expand their buffer zone in Manchuria. It is likely that they will go to war with us if we refuse. If we are not yet ready to face Japan in a total war, it may be wise to cede some land temporarily and force a confrontation later."
 japanese_diplomacy19opta: "We have no choice, we must give them more Manchurian land."
 japanese_diplomacy19optb: "We're ready for war. Push the Japanese off the mainland!"
 japanese_diplomacy20title: "China Cedes Manchuria"
 japanese_diplomacy20desc: "[From.GetLeader] has withdrawn [From.GetAdjective] troops from the West of Manchuria and allowed Japanese forces to occupy the rest of the region that they sought to conquer in 1930. A repeat of the Mukden Incident has been avoided, but China is now decisvely weaker. The world wonders if the non-aggression treaty will hold or if this is just the precursor for yet more Japanese demands."
 japanese_diplomacy20opta: "Interesting."
 japanese_diplomacy20optb: "Banzai!"
 japanese_diplomacy20optc: "This has bought us time to build up our forces."
 japanese_diplomacy21title: "Japan Demands Manchuria"
 japanese_diplomacy21desc: "[From.GetLeader] has rejected demands from Japan for the cession of further Manchurian territories. After the Mukden Incident in 1930, Japanese forces invaded China and seized large portions of land to establish a buffer zone. It now looks likely that a second Sino-Japanese War will follow."
 japanese_diplomacy21opta: "Concerning."
 japanese_diplomacy21optb: "Banzai!"
 japanese_diplomacy21optc: "Come break yourselves on our new Great Wall: our indomitable will."

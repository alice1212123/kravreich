 deluge_magic1title: "New Research Proposed"
 deluge_magic1desc: "Our recently appointed cabinet minister for supernatural affairs has requested additional resources to create a permanent research department for investigating the paranormal. This 'Department of Gnostic Conjuration and Experimental Thaumaturgy' would hire and train the best and brightest occultists, spirit mediums and magi and direct them towards uncovering mysteries where ever they can be found, in order to help [Root.GetNameDef] in her war efforts by developing new means of attack, and more importantly by acting as the first line of defence against possession by demons. Should such a malady occur in a senior official or general, the results could be catestrophic."
 deluge_magic1opta: "New avenues of research are always useful."
 deluge_magic1optb: "We can't spare the funding."
 tooltip_magic_department_accept: "§YA new research department will be opened under the authority of the cabinet minister.§!\n"
 tooltip_magic_department_refuse: "§YWithout adequate funding, research in this field will suffer.§!\n"
 deluge_magic2title: "Research Staff Missing"
 deluge_magic2desc: "The universities in the capital [Root.Capital.GetName] heartland have suffered some unexplained disappearances amongst the senior research staff in recent months. Many of them were reportedly critics of the newly opened Department of Gnostic Conjuration and Experimental Thaumaturgy, and our cabinet minister for supernatural affairs believes that the sceptical minds of the scientists allowed them to fall prey to possession attempts by invading demons. He assures us that with the proper training by his department, our science staff will be better prepared for warding off future demonic invasions."
 deluge_magic2opta: "Do anything it takes to prevent more disappearances."
 deluge_magic2optb: "We should turn the matter over to the civilian police."
 tooltip_magic_vetting_accept: "§YFuture researchers will be trained by the Department.§!\n"
 tooltip_magic_vetting_refuse: "§YThe disappearances might continue for some time.§!\n"

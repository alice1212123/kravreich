 lukasiewicz_desc: "A Polish author turned political, Łukasiewicz has begun constructing a new order in Europe. One that prides itself on national unity and strength and a burning hatred of Radicals and Monarchies especially in realtion to the French Empire that left them to bear the full force of the Russian and German armies during the Great War. The result of such a betrayal resulted in millions of Polish lives being lost in the name of imperialism and the first steps to the eventual deposing of the wettin king and the proclamation of Łukasiewicz becoming the father of the nation, their Ceaser. Europe nervously waits for Poland's next move but till then the world may rest under the corrupt grip of Napoleon's apparent "Immortal Empire"."

 deluge_poland1title: "A Modern Poland"
 deluge_poland1desc: "Poland has suffered a diffucult history at no fault of their own. Their existance as a country and an empire of sorts can be directly contributed by France and their position in world politics. The success from the Great War was a costly one almost bringing the entire nation to its knees. Millions of dead poles and one dipossing of a king later resulted in todays modern Poland. A state overseered by Łukasiewicz and the dependency, a collection of fellow ultra-nationalists that acts as a stop gap to prevent any one individual assuming total leadership of the nation, only as a figurehead that represents the collective as a whole that Łukasiewicz is officially doing. Though he has a different plan in mind. "

 deluge_poland2title: "The Last Conference"
 deluge_poland2desc: "Today marks the day Europe, more specifically Poland begins their proclaimed new age. While the conference did boast discussion about various policies and foreign affairs it all came to a abrupt end. Łukasiewicz, the Polish caeser annointed himself sole ruler of Poland and though voices grumbled ultimately there was nothing but dead silence. He proclaimed that Poland was soon to enter the war path and such turbulent times will need an iron fist by a capable leader none another then himself."

 deluge_poland3title: "The Disillusion Of The Dependency"
 deluge_poland3desc: "The doors to the conference room for the first time ever remained shut and locked for any that still didn't get the message that the New Order was upon Europe. Small scale protests were seen throughout Poland though none of these were large enough to draw eyes and even our once fellow fascists are turning to democracy or even worse, to the red tide. These political naysayers will be hunted, killed, and skinned like the pigs they are. Don't they realise that democracy is a lie, a system of corruption designed to benefit the elites? One day they will see through the fog even if that day is when they are staring down the barrel of a gun crying for their mothers to absolve them of their sins."

Many are waiting for France to muster a response to such claims and wonder if they will do anything to counter Poland's renewed imperialism though a military response from France seems very unlikely at this point. Hopefully Poland directs their expansion towards the many socialist states and bring an end to the cancerous threat that is radicalism."

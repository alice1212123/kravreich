 deluge_elections1title: "Election: Far-Left Set To Win"
 deluge_elections1desc: "The [Root.GetCommunistParty] are making gains in the polls after promising to increase spending on a wide array of social programmes.

 deluge_elections2title: "Election: Centrists Set To Win"
 deluge_elections2desc: "The [Root.GetDemocraticParty] are making gains in the polls after a campaign focusing on fiscal deficits and benefits fraud. It seems a few unscrupulous individuals were exposed in newspapers claiming subsidies unfairly, and the bureacracy of our welfare state failed to catch them.

 deluge_elections5title: "Election: Far-Right Set To Win"
 deluge_elections5desc: "The [Root.GetFascistParty] are making gains in the polls after a unleashing a torrent of racist rhetoric against immigrants and other foreigners. They argue our lax border controls are benefiting the wealthy by driving down wages, and that migrants should be forced into temporary work camps until they prove their loyalty to the nation. Recent polls show them moving into a slight lead."
 deluge_elections6title: "Election: Centre-Right Set To Win"
 deluge_elections6desc: "The [Root.GetNeutralParty] seem likely to win the upcoming elections, according to recent polls.

 deluge_elections8title: "Election: Far-Left Set To Win"

 deluge_elections9title: "Election: Far-Right Set To Win"
 deluge_elections9desc: "The [Root.GetFascistParty] are taking the lead in election polls.

An ultranationalist victory looks likely."
 deluge_elections10title: "Election: Centrists Set To Win"

The public have responded positively."
 deluge_elections12title: "Election: Far-Left Set To Win"
 deluge_elections12desc: "The [Root.GetCommunistParty] are concentrating their ire on our monetary policy, and have struck a chord with the public.

 deluge_elections14title: "Election: Far-Right Set To Win"
 deluge_elections14desc: "Inflation has reached record highs recently, and this has energised the [Root.GetFascistParty] election campaign.

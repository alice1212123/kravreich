 deluge_pomerania1title: "Fate of Pomerania"
 deluge_pomerania1desc: "Pomerania is a borderland between Poland and Germany, with significant cultural ties to both. Before being annexed into the Kingdom of Poland by Napoleon I, it was a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, and then part of Prussia and Sweden.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Great War, Poland agreed at Versailles to cede custodianship of the Pomeranian coast to France until conditions were stable enough for a plebiscite to be held on Pomerania's future.\n\nWith the end of the German Civil War, we can hold the plebiscite. We could also rule that the regimes in Germany and Poland are still too chaotic and make a decision without consulting the populace."

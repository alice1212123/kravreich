 deluge_americas2title: "Yanqui Imperialism"
 deluge_americas2desc: "The Americans seem keen on advancing their borders. While we would not be unhappy to see a republic consumed, a stronger America could upset the balance of power and allow the conquest of a good Monarchist realm, such as ours. We should appeal to the other Latin speaking nations in the Western Hemisphere for mutual protection from republicans and Yanquis alike."
 deluge_americas2opta: "Create the Latin Royalist bloc."
 deluge_americas2optb: "We have other plans."
 deluge_americas3title: "Latin Royalists"
 deluge_americas3desc: "The foreign ministry of [From.GetNameDef] has announced the formation of a military alliance of Latin nations in the Western Hemisphere. [From.GetLeader]'s intent seems to be to create a counterweight to the growing power of the Anglo and European nations. Whether any other kingdoms will commit themselves to the defence of another sovereign and join this new bloc remains to be seen."
 deluge_americas3opta: "Damned reactionaries!"
 deluge_americas3optb: "Concerning."
 deluge_americas3optc: "An impressive idea."
 deluge_americas3optd: "Decadent fools."
 deluge_americas4title: "Join the Latin Royalists?"
 deluge_americas4desc: "The growing strength of the Yanquis and the Europeans is a cause of deep concern. We may need military allies with similar mindsets in order to protect the institution of Monarchy, or at least the independence of our realms. We should join the Latin Royalist faction."
 deluge_americas4opta: "Yes, send the request."
 deluge_americas4optb: "We have other plans."
 deluge_americas5title: "[From.GetAdjective] Proposal"
 deluge_americas5desc: "[From.GetLeader] has communicated a desire to join our faction, the Latin Royalists. Whether [From.GetNameDef] is considered a powerful realm or not, it is at least one fewer potential enemy. We should admit them."
 deluge_americas5opta: "Welcome, [From.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_americas5optb: "Refuse them."
 deluge_americas7title: "Latin Royalists"
 deluge_americas7desc: "[From.GetLeader] has submitted an application for [From.GetAdjective] entry to the Latin Royalist faction, and [From.GetNameDef] is now a full member of the military alliance."
 deluge_americas7opta: "Protecting themselves from the people's retribution."
 deluge_americas7optb: "Concerning."
 deluge_americas7optc: "The Latin Royalists grow more powerful."
 deluge_americas7optd: "Weaklings. Numbers count for nothing."
 deluge_americas8title: "Louisiana Threatens Quebec"
 deluge_americas8desc: "[From.GetLeader] has issued revanchist rhetoric, urging the [From.GetAdjective] people to press their historic rights over their former territories in Quebec. The region was lost around 30 years ago to nationalist rebellions and has since gone through a period of radicalism which has seen the young republic more diplomatically isolated."
 deluge_americas8opta: "Death to the traitors!"
 deluge_americas8optb: "You will never step foot in [Root.GetNameDef], tyrants."
 deluge_americas8optc: "Remember to bring warm clothes, it's chillier than New Orleans."
 deluge_americas9title: "Mormonism Denounced by Louisiana"
 deluge_americas9desc: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the nation of Deseret is unfit to sit alongside the civilised countries of the world due to the 'barbaric practices of the decadent Mormons'. [From.GetNameDefCap] appears to be preparing for a military strike against her Western neighbour. The two nations have long suffered from poor relations due to occasional border wars."
 deluge_americas9opta: "Destroy the Mormon state!"
 deluge_americas9optb: "Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 deluge_americas9optc: "Who would wage a war over the barren wastes of Utah?"
 deluge_americas10title: "Louisiana Demands Texas"
 deluge_americas10desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued a demand to the Mexican government over its Texan provinces. The oil-rich region was agreed to belong to the successor state of the Viceroyalty of New Spain a hundred years ago, but [From.GetLeader]'s administration seems to desire 'renegotiation' over their national boundaries. The [From.GetAdjective] armed forces are on high alert."
 deluge_americas10opta: "Texas is culturally [Root.GetAdjective]!"
 deluge_americas10optb: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] will prevail!"
 deluge_americas10optc: "[From.GetLeader] doesn't much look like a steer."
 deluge_americas11title: "Algonquian-Louisiana Tensions Mount"
 deluge_americas11desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has urged the Algonquian nation to give their troops basing rights in the northern republic, supposedly to modernise and protect the Native American state from foreign aggression. [From.GetLeader]'s demands were rebuffed as a naked attempt to annex a weaker neighbour. Troops movements on both sides of the border are increasing."
 deluge_americas11opta: "The Indians need civilising!"
 deluge_americas11optb: "Death to [From.GetAdjective] imperialism!"
 deluge_americas11optc: "Who would turn down the obvious benefits of Louisianan culture?"
 deluge_americas12title: "Louisiana Demands the Great Lakes"
 deluge_americas12desc: "Citing irregulaties in the treaty that ended the Seven Years' War of 1764, the administration of [From.GetLeader] has demanded the return of Ohio, Michigan and the other Great Lakes states from the American government. The Americans have condemned the naked aggression of [From.GetNameDef]. A declaration of war is believed to be imminent."
 deluge_americas12opta: "Smash the Yanquis!"
 deluge_americas12optb: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] will prevail!"
 deluge_americas12optc: "If they have the receipt, they should get store credit at least."
 deluge_americas13title: "Louisiana Demands Unification with France"
 deluge_americas13desc: "The Bourbons fled to Louisiana in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Now the [From.GetAdjective] government is urging its people to prepare for a great return to the Fatherland, presumably at the head of an invading army. The French government has withdrawn its ambassadors and condemned the warmongering of [From.GetLeader]'s government."
 deluge_americas13opta: "Long live [Root.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_americas13optb: "Long live [Root.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_americas13optc: "Good luck on your voyage across the Atlantic."
 deluge_americas14title: "Spanish Carribean Threatened"
 deluge_americas14desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is believed to have been deploying more troops and warships to the Carribean in a buildup aimed at seizing the last remaining Spanish territories in the Western Hemisphere. While amphibious invasions of Cuba and Puerto Rico may be successful, Spanish acceptance of their loss could take some time, and a prolonged war may be imminent."
 deluge_americas14opta: "Spaniards are cowards."
 deluge_americas14optb: "You fled from Europe once, you will not get away a second time."
 deluge_americas14optc: "Desperate for Cuban rum to relieve the misery of living in a swamp?"
 deluge_americas15title: "Louisiana Moves Capital to Paris"
 deluge_americas15desc: "The newly rechristened nation of [From.GetNameDef] has moved her administrative and political capital back to Paris, after a hundred years of exile in New Orleans. The seizure of mainland France by the exile forces shocked the world, and now the seizure has been cemented with the force of law. [From.GetLeader] has celebrated with a tour of the palace at Versailles, and of the Tuileries, made infamous as the last stand of the doomed Swiss Guard, who perished to protect the Bourbon king from Revolutionaries in 1791."
 deluge_americas15opta: "Vive la France!"
 deluge_americas15optb: "Our congratulations to [From.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_americas15optc: "Frenchmen are the natural enemies of other Frenchmen."

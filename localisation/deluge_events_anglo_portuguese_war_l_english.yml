 a_p_war1title: "British Warmongers"
 a_p_war1desc: "The treacherous British have repudiated the Treaty of Versailles! They are claiming Portuguese colonial officials are abusing British subjects in Kenya and that this invalidates the treaty! They are liars and warmongers!"

 a_p_war2title: "Africa Is Lost"

 a_p_war3title: "Portugal Seeks Peace"
 a_p_war3desc: "Our imperial forces have taken Luanda, Mombasa and Salisbury. We have essentially achieved the goals we laid out to the world upon declaration of war - the protection of British subjects in Portuguese Africa. We could, of course, extend the war goals to include West Africa, Goa and Mysore."

 a_p_war7title: "Portugal Is Defeated"
 a_p_war7desc: "Through superior tactics and strategy we have seized all the Portuguese possessions in Africa and India. We can sign a peace that restores some of our pre-Versailles borders. We could pursue war goals against the Portuguese homeland, but such an act would surely enrage the world."

 a_p_war7optb: "British troops will march through Lisbon!"
 a_p_war8title: "Anglo-Portuguese War"
 a_p_war8desc: "The recent hostilities between Portugal and Britain have ended in a peace that sees the reversal of many of the changes enacted at Versailles. Britain has even extended her imperial borders into colonies that were never part of her empire before the Great War."

 a_p_war9opta: "Shocking!"
 a_p_war9optb: "Wipe away the stain of Versailles!"
 a_p_war9optc: "Lunatic warmongers!"

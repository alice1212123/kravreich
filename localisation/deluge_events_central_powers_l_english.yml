 central_powers2title: "Join Central Powers?"
 central_powers2desc: "We have been offered a place with the [From.GetAdjective] military bloc. This might help stave off Serbian and Hungarian aggression, or it could isolate us from French assistance in the event of a betrayal. We must choose wisely."
 central_powers2opta: "We will join the Poles."
 central_powers2optb: "We prefer the French bloc."
 central_powers2optc: "We are better off alone."
 central_powers3title: "Join Central Powers?"

 central_powers4optd: "We have other plans."

 central_powers5opta: "We will join the French bloc."
 central_powers5optb: "We are better off alone."
 central_powers5optc: "We have other plans."
 central_powers6title: "Join Central Powers?"
 central_powers6desc: "We have been offered a place with the [From.GetAdjective] military bloc. We bled and died in the mountains of Piedmont and Isonzo for a Central Powers victory but it was for nought. We could rejoin our old allies, or we could look elsewhere for protection."

 central_powers6optb: "We prefer the French bloc."

 central_powers8optb: "Let them fend for themselves."
 central_powers9title: "Ultranationalist Coup Attempt"
 central_powers9desc: "The influence wielded by the Polish ultranationalists has borne fruit in our nation.

 central_powers9opta: "[Root.GetLeader] is holding back [Root.GetAdjective] national rejuvenation!"
 central_powers9optb: "[Root.GetLeader] is the rightful ruler!"
 central_powers10title: "Recovering Kosovo"
 central_powers10desc: "The Albanians were awarded Kosovo and Montenegro in the Treaty of Versailles. Serbia was cut down to a fragment of our former glory, but the Great War has ended, the French troops have gone home, and we doubt they will return just to save the ridiculous King Zog from our just revenge. Let us request permission from our powerful Polish ally to attack the Albanians."
 central_powers10opta: "War is inevitable."
 central_powers10optb: "We should look for other options."
 central_powers11title: "Serbia Seeks War"
 central_powers11desc: "Our ally, [From.GetLeader], has communicated a desire to recover the lands in Kosovo and Montenegro lost by Serbia at the Treaty of Versailles. This could be a good opportunity to strengthen our bloc and destroy a potential enemy. We might also be able to bring the Greeks on board, if they aren't already set on another faction - they will surely jump at the chance to seize Epirus."
 central_powers11opta: "Give permission to the Serbs and Greeks to attack."
 central_powers11optb: "We do not need the Greeks, but tell [From.GetLeader] to proceed."

 central_powers12optb: "Sounds too risky."
 central_powers13title: "Poland Backs Us"
 central_powers13desc: "[From.GetLeader] has given us the go-ahead. We may begin our attack on Albania when we please. Our diplomatic wrangling has not gone unnoticed, and the Albanians will likely be alerted before long."
 central_powers13opt: "[From.GetNameDefCap] are truly beneficent allies."
 central_powers14title: "Poland Forbids Attack"
 central_powers14desc: "[From.GetLeader] has communicated disapproval of our plan to attack Albania. [From.GetNameDefCap] will likely refuse to back us in any Serbo-Albanian war. [Root.GetNameDefCap] is not a snivelling dog to be kicked around. We should attack the Albanians anyway."
 central_powers14opta: "We don't need Poland."
 central_powers14optb: "We should follow [From.GetLeader]'s direction."
 central_powers15title: "Serbo-Albanian War Imminent"
 central_powers15desc: "Diplomatic wrangling between Serbia and Poland has finally ended after several days of secret meetings and discussions. The specifics of the discussions are unknown to the public, but troop movements along the Albanian border seem to indicate a surprise Serbian attack is forthcoming.

 central_powers17opta: "The tyrant clings to the flimsiest of excuses."
 central_powers17optb: "That is surely illegal, even in wartime?"
 central_powers17optc: "Let the boy win his spurs!"
 central_powers17optd: "Hungary needs a strong wartime leader."
 central_powers18title: "King Albert's Regency Continues"
 central_powers18desc: "Field Marshal Horthy was appointed Regent of Hungary by the Diet in 1930, after the death of György I.\n\nToday marks Albert I's 18th birthday, but the young king has reportedly been placed under house arrest to prevent him addressing his loyal subjects.\n\nThe Hungarian Diet, dominated by Horthy's ultranationalists, has given permission for the Regency to continue indefinitely."

 central_powers19opta: "They have merely swapped one tyrant for another."
 central_powers19optb: "A peaceful exchange of power is always preferable."
 central_powers19optc: "God save [From.GetLeader]!"
 central_powers19optd: "That was a mistake, Hungary needs a strong leader."

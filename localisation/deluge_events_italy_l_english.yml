 deluge_italy1title: "Matters Of State"
 deluge_italy1desc: "A unified Italian state has only existed for a little over a hundred years. With the aid of Emperor Napoleon I, we were able to crush the Habsburgs and the Papacy in our drive outwards. It is not surprising for many to say that this new Italian State, first a republic, would just be yet another client state under the French sphere. After the Great War, there was much promise for Italy's future as a great power. With a Navy that had begun to nearly be on par with France and Great Britain and substantial control over Mediterranean politics and trade, this was almost assured. However, these dreams would come crashing down after the outbreak of the Sicilian Riots. Caused by a the North's seeming neglect of the impoverished South, the Neapolitans and Sicilians eventually began holding mass demonstrations and riots.  The Monarchy proved inneffectual with dealing with these events and eventually the Military had to step in to prevent the situation from getting any worse. Air Marshal Italo Balbo soon became Head of State, overseeing many of the Monarchy's decisions. The Monarchy gradually lost it's governing powers overtime and was eventually forcefully abolished under the threat of another revolt. With the abolition of the Monarchy, Italy became a de facto Military Dictatorship. With growing resentment towards the Junta, the people are demanding a Referendum on the future of Italy's political future"

 deluge_italy2title: "The Referendum"
 deluge_italy2desc: "After continous calls for a referendum to decide Italy's political future, the ruling Junta have listened and the vote is currently underway. On the moderate side of the referendum we have the Conservatives and the Liberals. The Conservatives and Liberals both want to push Italy further into becoming a Republic. Whereas on the Extreme side we have the Marxists and the Fascists. The Marxists want the establishment of a Federal Proletarian Worker's and Peasants Republic. The Roman Movement, a fascist party under the leadership of Philosopher and Educator Giovanni Gentile, seeks a more extreme contiuation of the Dicatorship. They also seek a national rebirth, with their uniforms and symbols harkening back to the Roman Republic and Empire. Only time will tell who will win."

Many are against the idea of the restoring a empire long gone from recent history though many are also supportive for such a change. Rome was built on idea's far from similar when refering to Radical beliefs, an alteration of concepts under a new Roman banner would be seen by many as the way Rome should have been administered, that is if we prove succesful in our own leadership and nation building."

 deluge_italy8desc: "How does one begin to describe one of, if not the most powerful and influential empires to ever exist. At their peak they controlled vast portions of Europe namely the Mediterranean where their cultral and religious beliefs left a mark on every nation they conquered. While this newly announced Rome is far from what she use to be the ambitious nation could undoubtly grow her size as politcal enemies are all but aplenty. The question in everyone's mind is how modern will this ancient nation be and will she meet her fortunate fate at the very people she conquered so long ago?"

While questionable ideologies have been gaining attention in Italy ever since the conclusion of the great war majority of these far from average thinkers have belonged to the many Ultra-Nationalist parties and/or far right groups that litter Italy. What ever the case may be this unexpected change in political leadership is sure to have a profound effect on Europe as a whole, maybe, just maybe on the whole world to."

[From.GetAdjective] forces are withdrawing from South Tyrol and the populace there is celebrating their new union with the Italian Fatherland. This move has taken much of the wind out of our revanchist sails, as we have little claim on the German-speaking regions of Tyrol which remain in Austria. If we press the issue further, we will have little support if things turn sour."

Though the Italians are believed to have demanded much more from the Austrians, this offering has pleased most revanchists in [From.GetNameDef] and left the government with little legitimate reason to press for more demands, at least in the eyes of the international community.

Frogmen, marines and parachutists (many of them veterans of the Great War who defended Malta from repeated French invasions of the island) landed in force and overwhelmed the local garrison, who quickly surrendered.

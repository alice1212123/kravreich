 australia888title: "The Status Of Oceania"
 australia888desc: "Since the days of British imperialism the colonies of Oceania were split between Australia and New Zealand. This all changed when only a year after the great wars conclusion a workers strike erupted in christchurch after industrial bureaucrats refused to increase wages that at the time were far below the national standard due to Britians request for the dominions to increase their naval budgets to counter the japaneses naval build up. At this point both the Australian and New Zealand economies were severly weakened and what was once only a city issue quickly spread around the nation. With Britians blessing General Bridges who was now effectively head of state of Australia after a military coup de'tat against what was at the time a very radical based parliment stationed troops across New Zealand. What was thought to be a timed occupation from the Australian military soon became an outright annexation attempt that proved successful under Britains backing. Now various political organisations and independece movements have begun violently opposing Bridges regime and if the broken political situation isn't delt with now then all hell may break loose."

 australia887title: "The Naval Question"
 australia887desc: "The naval build up request that Britian forwarded towards Oceania has had an incredible tow on the Oceanic economy. The resources, manpower, and engineering might that she had to gather was something simply unheard of. The program is due to end in 3 years time though we can close it indefinitely as unrest and public outcry is reaching uncontrollable heights or we can maintain the program as there is some support for it to stay.\n\n§RDeciding to remove or keep the naval build up will anger people either way, the question is who do you want to piss off. You will be able to end the program when ever you wish to via a decision if the effects of continuing the naval build up is to severe.§R"

 australia884title: "The Collapse Of Oceania"
 australia884desc: "After years of Authoritarian rule and continous oppression of political enemies and native peoples the once united nation state of Oceania has finally attended her overdue meeting with the Grimreaper. Unsurprisingly the dominion has been forced into a state of emergency as numerous violent protests have turned into full scale battle fields. As a result of Bridges failed leadership a prominent and charismatic general Jacob Stills has seized the moment to name himself Governor of oceania, or whats left of it that is."

 australia882title: "Defence Plan Red Sapphire"
 australia882desc: "Oceania has always been seen as a possible victim of Japanese imperialism. To counter such a possible reality Oceania by Britian's request began building a defensive fleet with the capabilities of putting a deep scratch into Japan's navy. This one on one battle that Oceania would have in the seas was only planned to last until British help arrived though the sinking reality of such a fleet manouvre is slowly becoming true and we may find ourselves all but alone. Defence Plan Red Sapphire is meant to counter any naval invasion that Japan might have by building naval forts across Oceania with cities and harbours being the main investment."

 australia881desc: "What is seen by many as a drastic change of leadership by the general who has proven to ease the rattled populations of Oceania with various positive decisions and promises. Whether Bridges is to still remain in power is yet to be decided but what is surely garuenteed is there wont be any protests against his continued leadership if that becomes the case."

 australia883title: "Bridges Remains In Power"
 australia883desc: "Bridges has come to the decision that he after dealing with Oceania's many problematic issues is the only person fit to rule the dominion and push it into a bright future. This certaintly wasn't a humble brag by any means and has become all but a true reality with the once questionable leadership of Bridges now no longer a controversial topic it seems many aren't hard pressed against his desire to continue to govern in fact many are welcoming of it."

 australia880desc: "Bridges has announced to the public that he will be offically stepping down as governer of the dominion and passing leadership to the Earle Page, a democratic sympathiser who will undoubtedly begin to transition Oceania to a more fair and equal society. While some more devout loyalists of Bridges are confused in his sudden surrendering of leadership many are joyful that a new age of democracy is all but guaranteed."

 australia873title: "The Second Workers Strike Of Christchurch"
 australia873desc: "The church bells rang to the sounds of violent protests in the infamous city of Christchurch. Home to the first workers strike to be ever recorded in a British dominion and it seems a sequel, a violent one at that, has played out once agian. The difference being that there was no New Zealand flag to bear witness to the savagery that unfolded against the local military garrisons as police embarrassingly failed to control the escalating protest. While no official response has been heard from the Oceanic leadership one can only begin to imagine the brutality that occured. Rumours say that the ultra-nationalist movement the "New Zealand Patriots" instigated the protest though there has been no conclusive evidence that was the cause. Whatever the case may be one sure fact is that this has deepily hampered the ruling governor, William Bridges, attempts at reforming the nation."

 australia872desc: "As it is our responsibility to guard Asia there is the quite obvious question on what to do with Britian's treaty ports. We could no doubt garrison the small city holdings though this would require more work on our behalf. In return for gaurding the ports Britian could grant us the china fleet this way both parties benefit."

 australia871desc: "Our dominion over in Asia, Oceania, has sent us a proposal regarding our treaty ports in china. They request the China Fleet to be placed into their hands and in return they will go the extra mile and garrison our treaty ports for us. While this would bolster the defenses of the cities undoubtly and free troops up for the mainland we would be further increasing their naval might. Of course we have final say on this matter so whatever we choose Oceania will have to accept as fact."

 australia868desc: "As the dust settled the sounds of rioting silenced themselves for a few short moments. The flag of Oceania which once hunged high off of parliment house was now alight quite literally. Crowds mustered around the local military garrison stationed near the capitol and the onslaught shortly occured only moments after. Britian has consequently lost her most loyal dominion and the question of who will now protect their interests in Asia has been put on hold. For now though the fires of revolution and independence have violently erupted to uncontrollable heights and if the situation isn't dealt with quickly then who knows whats next for the dominion."

Some people have driven as far as rural Australia just to get a hold of the drink."

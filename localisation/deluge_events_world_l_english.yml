Tour operators are creating package holidays that take care of everything from flights to hotels to outings in historic locations around the world. The cheapening cost of airline tickets is taking what was previously a luxury enjoyed by the most wealthy and opening it up to the growing middle class. This is making their nation richer and exposing [Root.GetAdjective] people to new cultures from around the globe."

 deluge_world3title: "Interpreters of Napoleon"
 deluge_world3desc: "Our general staff have been re-examining many of the army's foundational doctrines since the Great War and now thought is turning to the great strategists and tacticians of the 19th century who formed the basis of our old textbooks - Jomini, Clausewitz and Bülow.\nJomini's ideas centred on lines of communication and bases of operation. He believed that geographically outmaneuvering the enemy was the most efficient means of winning a war, which required surprising the enemy by striking at vulnerable spots, and that a sufficiently advanced general could achieve victory without even fighting a decisive battle against the main enemy forces.\nClausewitz looked instead to the mass conscript armies as the basis of victory, believing modern war would become more and more total in nature. In the 'perfect' war, psychology and morale would play the key role, with geography and maneuver relegated to secondary concerns. Neutralising the enemy army - whether by battle or surrender - would be more important than seizing territory.\nBülow's ideas were more successful in the field of light infantry tactics, but strategically he believed mathematics was the key to victory, with successful attacks dictated by choosing the correct angles of incidence to the enemy."
 deluge_world3opta: "Jomini's ideas are elegant and efficient."
 deluge_world3optb: "Clausewitz understood modern war. Friction is everything."
 deluge_world3optc: "Bülow was a mad genius. We should examine his ideas more closely"
 deluge_world3optd: "The ideas of these dead men have been outdated for decades. We'll find our own way."
 deluge_world4title: "Antoine-Henri Jomini"
 deluge_world4desc: "A Switzer who joined the Revolutionary armies at a young age, Jomini achieved rapid promotion under Napoleon thanks to his intelligence and diligence. He was an admirer of Frederick the Great's lightning war in Silesia and of the school of rationalism, which holds that humanity is progressing towards a scientific understanding of all endeavours. He therefore believed in scientific rules of war which good generals should obey or else face disaster.\nHis strategic ideas became a mainstay of general staffs during the Long Nineteenth Century, where limited wars between the Great Powers and their small standing armies necessitated superior mobility and maneuver. By bringing enough force to a critical spot in the enemy's lines of communication, Jomini believed victory could be achieved as a matter of course, like a chess game unfolding. Surrender would be assured and needless bloodshed avoided.\nFinding the critical spot to strike, and assuring that one's plans are not betrayed and the critical spot reinforced, means superior intelligence is essential to victory."
 deluge_world5title: "Carl von Clausewitz"
 deluge_world5desc: "A Prussian who fought Napoleon as a junior officer, Clausewitz saw the small professional armies of the Ancien Régime shattered by the mass conscript armies of a nationalistic France. This change from the limited war of dynasty against dynasty to the absolute (or 'perfect') war of people against people, where the entire population throws itself into the cause of war, informed his ideas on how war should be waged and its relationship to society - he coined the maxim that 'war is the continuation of politics by other means'. His ideas were elastic principles rather than rigid rules and the idea of friction - of things going wrong - plays a key role. For example, an offensive will gradually lose its momentum as the defender accrues more advantages from terrain, shorter supply lines and patriotic defiance, until eventually the culminating point is reached and a counter-offensive will throw back the aggressor.\nThe relative peace of the Long Nineteenth Century once seemed to indicate a reversion to limited wars, but the holocaust of the Great War appears to have vindicated Clausewitz."
 deluge_world6title: "Dietrich von Bülow"
 deluge_world6desc: "A Prussian whose contempt for his own state's deficiencies led to him joining the French, Bülow was lucky to have survived the Napoleonic wars, as a French defeat would likely have meant his death in gaol.\nA scion of the Enlightenment, Bülow believed that military affairs should be ordered by a central commanding intelligence, with the generals and armies implementing the commander's master plan with little autonomy. Naturally he saw Napoleon in this commanding role, and he opposed Prussian autocracy in favour of the nationalism of France which was sweeping through Europe like a flood at the time. Believing French victory to be inevitable, he was imprisoned for his defeatist publications and attitude. After being liberated by the destruction of the Prussian state, he sought to enter French service but was shunned by the senior command for his stubborness and pathological egotism. Since his theories on military strategies based purely on mathematical principles were never implemented, they remain undeveloped, but his ideas on geopolitics and infantry tactics were pioneering works. He accurately predicted the shape of post-Napoleonic Europe based on natural and national barriers."

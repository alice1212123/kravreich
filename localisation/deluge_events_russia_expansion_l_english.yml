 deluge_recently_rejected_applicant: "Recently Rejected Applicant"
 deluge_recently_rejected_applicant_desc: "We recently rejected the application of a nation to our faction. Hopefully other countries will get the message that we don't tolerate freeloaders."
 russia_expansion1title: "Russian Threats"
 russia_expansion1desc: "As we feared, the Russians seem to be finalising their plans to invade [Root.GetNameDef]. They claim that our nation is but a province of [From.GetNameDef] that was torn away by thieves and rabblerousers. Hopefully, we can withstand their onslaught until help arrives from Russia's many enemies."
 russia_expansion1opt: "We must prepare our defences!"
 russia_expansion2title: "Russians Mobilising"
 russia_expansion2desc: "Grave news! Troop movements on our mutual borders, public statements, and internal propaganda broadcasts all seem to indicate a Russian invasion of our homeland is fast approaching! Fortunately Russia has many enemies, and we can appeal to some of them to aid us. If they refuse, we will all fall like dominoes."
 russia_expansion2opta: "Our comrades will surely help us."
 russia_expansion2optb: "Our friends will surely help us."
 russia_expansion2optc: "Our peers will surely help us."
 russia_expansion2optd: "Our volksgenossen will surely help us."
 russia_expansion2opte: "We must stand alone."
 russia_expansion3title: "Alliance Request"
 russia_expansion3desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have communicated their desire to join our faction. They admit that they are compelled to seek our aid due to mounting Russian aggression against them. This could pose a danger to our own security, but Russian expansionism must be contained at some point, or all her neighbours will fall like dominoes."
 russia_expansion3opta: "We welcome our new ally."
 russia_expansion3optb: "Let them stand alone."
 russia_expansion4title: "Russian Expansionism"
 russia_expansion4desc: "[SOV.GetNameDef] is on the move. They are preparing troops and propaganda for an assault on one of the breakaway republics they border. This may put Russian forces on our very doorstep, and we are not certain they will stop their advance there. We could appeal to France to protect us as part of the Continental System, or we could issue a call to arms from other Islamic nations. We could also ally with the Russians, if they are willing to give us the cities of Baku and Yerevan as a buffer zone."
 russia_expansion4opta: "Offer to join the Russian bloc."
 russia_expansion4optb: "Ask France for protection."
 russia_expansion4optc: "Islam must unite under the Caliph."
 russia_expansion4optd: "We will stand alone."
 russia_expansion5title: "Alliance Request"
 russia_expansion5desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have communicated their desire to join our faction. They request protection from French and British imperialism in exchange for their assistance in future wars. They also desire that our buffer zone in the Caucasian area be drawn further away from Turkey proper."
 russia_expansion5opta: "We welcome our new ally."
 russia_expansion5optb: "The Caucasus belongs to Russia!"
 russia_expansion6title: "Russo-Turkish Alliance"
 russia_expansion6desc: "The Russian and Turkish states have agreed to a formal military alliance.\n\nThe ancient enemies have been fighting for centuries over land and influence in the Balkans and Caucasus, but have set aside their differences to create a bloc that can rival France and Britain in strength."
 russia_expansion6opta: "Very concerning."
 russia_expansion6optb: "A toast to our new friends!"
 russia_expansion7title: "Russia Rejects Alliance"
 russia_expansion7desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has rejected our request for an alliance. This is very concerning as it implies a future advance into the Caucasus may not stop at Turkey's border. We must appeal to either France or the Islamic world for aid!"
 russia_expansion7opta: "Ask France for protection."
 russia_expansion7optb: "Islam must unite under the Caliph."
 russia_expansion7optc: "We will stand alone."
 russia_expansion8title: "Alliance Request"
 russia_expansion8desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have communicated their desire to join our faction. They admit that they are compelled to seek our aid due to mounting Russian aggression against them. This could pose a danger to our own security, but Russian expansionism must be contained at some point, or all her neighbours will fall like dominoes."
 russia_expansion8opta: "We welcome our new ally."
 russia_expansion8optb: "We cannot risk a war with Russia."
 russia_expansion9title: "Franco-Turkish Alliance"
 russia_expansion9desc: "The French and Turkish states have agreed to a formal military alliance.\n\nAllies during the Great War, it is unsurprising the French would vouch for Turkey again. It seems the mounting Russian militarism and revanchist rhetoric sparked concerns in Constantinople over a future Russo-Turkish war.\n\nPresumably, the Continental System will preclude any such war. Or make it that much bloodier."
 russia_expansion9opta: "Very concerning."
 russia_expansion9optb: "A toast to our new friends!"
 russia_expansion10title: "France Rejects Alliance"
 russia_expansion10desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has rejected our request for an alliance. Our Great War alliance appears to have been one of convenience for the French. We must appeal to the Islamic world for protection from French and Russian aggression."
 russia_expansion10opta: "Islam must unite under the Caliph."
 russia_expansion10optb: "We will stand alone."
 russia_expansion11title: "Turkey Calls for Aid"
 russia_expansion11desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued an appeal to the Islamic world to enter into a military pact under Turkey's leadership. Russian militarism and revanchist rhetoric is believed to be the cause of this.\n\nWhile the Caliph's role has diminished after the Young Turk rebellion, he formally remains the head of state and it is likely many of the Gulf and Near-Eastern states will answer the call."
 russia_expansion11opta: "Allahu Akbar!"
 russia_expansion11optb: "Allahu Akbar!"
 russia_expansion11optc: "Very concerning."
 russia_expansion12title: "Russian Expansionism"
 russia_expansion12desc: "The Russians are expanding towards their republican neighbours. While we feel little love for European radicals, if Russia grows back to her pre-Napoleonic borders she will be large enough to threaten China's independence. We may wish to strike first, while her armies are busy, and seize a buffer zone in Central Asia."
 russia_expansion12opta: "We must pre-empt their aggression against us."
 russia_expansion12optb: "We will manage Russia in some other way."
 russia_expansion13title: "China Mobilises"
 russia_expansion13desc: "Russian border guards watch [From.GetNameDef] with growing apprehension, as troop movements become more and more threatening. It seems China wishes to strike at the Russians while they are occupied elsewhere."
 russia_expansion13opta: "To victory!"
 russia_expansion13optb: "Bastards!"
 russia_expansion13optc: "Very concerning."
 russia_expansion15title: "Soviet Union Announced"
 russia_expansion15desc: "For some time, [From.GetLeader] has been urging the peoples of the former Russian Empire to enter into an ever closer political union under a single state that is representative of all the fraternal nations of the region, as understood by the ruling [From.GetRulingParty]. That policy has borne fruit as [From.GetNameDef] has been declared, supposedly 'underlining the unity of the Soviet peoples'.\n\nWhether this turn of events will prove to be a blessing or a curse for Russia's neighbours remains to be seen, but there is significant opposition from within the country to this centralisation of power under a party that is taking a hard turn to Radicalism."
 russia_expansion15opta: "United forever in friendship and labour!"
 russia_expansion15optb: "They are just as huge a menace, whatever their name."
 russia_expansion15optc: "What will [From.GetLeader]'s next move be?"

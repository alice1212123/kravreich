  america_deluge_dixie_attack: "Take the fight to them!"
  america_deluge_dixie_attack_desc: "Byrd's idea of defence against the Yankees makes no sense. The American Republic has far more resources than us, while the Boston Government is supported by foreign traitors and oligarchs. If we wait to much, they'll crush our brave new nation. Long's plan of attacking them before they are ready is our only viable option."
  america_deluge_dixie_ford: "Contact Ford"

  USA_csa_internal_conflicts_desc: "The South has managed to achieve the goal all Dixies desire since Andrew Jackson, the champion of the people, was impeached under the leadership of the yankee tyrants. However, division is brewing in the Southern camp. Democrat Chairman Huey Long is proposing a new radical idea: the creation of a pan-American social republic, where the north and the south are not devided by racial and social isssues but are united to provide welfare and support to all loyal citizens. Of course, Byrd and his inner circle believe Long is just an upstart populist who whishes to seize power for himself, but the question remains: what is Dixieland, and what is America?"

  deluge_csa2title: "The South Rises"
  deluge_csa2desc: "When Andrew Jackson  was impeached, all people in the South knew that the Kingdom of America was actually two nations living together in a single body. For the past fifty years the Democratic Party and the Southern Federalists have built an invincible political machine in the South, and finally Harry Byrd has managed to achieve our dreams of secession. Byrd leds a circle of reactionary politicians, including William H. Murray, which want to create and independent Dixie kingdom in the South, but they are far from completely controlling the country.\n\nByrd has in the past years relied on the help of the KKK, which now act as a sort of paramilitary and semi-official police force. The KKK has its own goals, including the creation of a "Dixie Empire" which stretches from florida to northern Mexico. Opposing the KKK and the Byrd Fundation, there is the Democratic Party chairman, Huey Long, who has modernized the party in the past years turning it into a modern nationalist and populist force. Long has declared that the time of southern secessionism is over, and that Dixie troops should march to Philadelphia to cxreate a new American state, one where "the king is not a Hamilton bastard but every man is a king." Long has some unorthodox economic ideas, but his support among common men is high, and he even appears as the only hope for black emancipation. Long has also powerful friends, and he has manged to compose a weird inconsistent nationalist coaliton."

  deluge_csa3title: "Protecting Dixieland"
  deluge_csa3desc: "Regent Byrd has issued executive order 1, which sets up a nationwide rally campaign to form a true professional Souther Army. While this will take a lot of time, we're already converting former State Guards into the Dixie Army. These are true southern patriots, who know their aligence is not to the Yankee nation but to a true Dixie state, which will soon spread its wings across the American continent. Governor Murray has offered his complete support, and is contributing a lot to our effort."
  deluge_csa3opt: "We'll defend the fatherland"
  deluge_csa4title: "The Defence of Richmond"
  deluge_csa4desc: "The Northern tyrants are coming to destroy Dixieland. We must prepare for the wrost. Harry Byrd, togther with governor Murray, has set up a defence plan for the city of Richmon, the jewel of Vriginia. Trenches are being made, rifles are being distributed to Virginian boys and the proud Dixie flag waves on every house and in every street. The red bastards will now that they are entering a fortress."
  deluge_csa4opt: "Let them come"
  deluge_csa5title: "Patton promoted to Dixie Field Marshall"
  deluge_csa5desc: "General George S. Patton, well known southern patriot and stounch defender of jim crow and connected with the KKK. Patton belongs to the secessionist faction, and has claimed to do whatever it takes to defend the country. Patton is an aggressive general, prone to violence and who believes massive firepower and armored assault is the best way to crush the red devils."
  deluge_csa5opt: "Patton will defend Dixieland!"
  deluge_csa6title: "Northern defectors"
  deluge_csa6desc: "As the socialist regime takes power in Philadelphia, more and more Yankee Americans are fleeing south, proclaming loyality to the Kingdom of Vriginia. They are mostly far-right politicians and northern democrats, loyal to Long's cause or corporatists oligarchs who fear Kennedy will break up their monopolies. Among them there is aviator star Charles Lindbergh, general Van Horn Moseley and politician Gerald K. Smith, one of Long's closest collaborators in the North. Byrd has accepted their help in defending Virginia, but most of these men are not actually Dixie patriosts, but pan-American ultranationalist who share Long's view of a united American Empire, which not divides north and south but unites them in their joint struggle against the Frenchmen and the socialists."
  deluge_csa6opt: "We need all possible help"
  deluge_csa7title: "The Klan organizes raids"
  deluge_csa7desc: "With the Kingdom of Virginia established, many Klansmen have seized this opportunity to unleash their terror in the south, forcing many afro americans to flee north or to Louisiana. The Klan, while legalized, should not have the power to cnduct these terrorist acts, and Regent Byrd fears a Klan takeover with the Grand Wizad becoming more and more radicalized. However, while many in the South fear an uncontrolled klan and Long openly calls for its abolishment, Governor Murray and close advisor of Byrd, is a stunch suppporter of them and is protecting their influence and crimes."
  deluge_csa7opt: "The Klan could be dangerous even to Dixieland"
  deluge_csa8title: "Patton creates the motorized corps"
  deluge_csa8desc: "General Patton is a firm proponent of mechanized warfare. The South holds a terrifying disadvantage in terms of manpower and industry if compared to the North: the Yankee have a far stronger industry and there are simply more people willingly to fight for them than for the pride Dixie flag. Our segregated society also reduces our total manpower poll.\n\nPatton, recognizing these problems, has allowed the formation of the Dixie Armored Corps, creating four division comprising tanks and motorized units. Patton thinks that a defensive strategy may still be succesful, but we need elite units to lead armored spearheads inside Yankee territory if we want to save Dixieland."
  deluge_csa8opt: "Patton is right!"
  deluge_csa9title: "Long mobilizes Democratic paramilitaries"
  deluge_csa9desc: "To chairman Long is clear that we have to act quickly. We have no time to prepare and form a proper regular army to fight the Northeners. Without approval from Byrd's government Long has ordered the mobilization of Democratic Party's parmilitaries, distributing rifles to the many young volunteers eager to crush the northern red snakes. Byrd is furious of this choice, because it diverts resources from the construction of a proper regular army and de-facto locks Virgnia in following a path of offensive warfare. Byrd beleives this choice will weaken Dixie nationalism, because our soldiers won't be fighting to protect Dixieland but to reclaim the dead nation of America."
  deluge_csa9opt: "What the hell is Long doing?"
  deluge_csa10title: "Ford-Lindbergh secret meeting"
  deluge_csa10desc: "It was a cold morning in Memphis. In a room of a dirty hotel in the outskirts of the city, one of the richest men on the American continent was calmly listening to a younger, charming man, dressed in an aviation uniform. Henry Ford had seen better days. He had spent the last months rnning away from red militias searching for class traitors across the Great Lakes, and had been forced to flee his beloved Chicago to see asylum in the Kingdom of Louisiana. He hated the damn French, they were so arrogant and seemed to always look down on him.\n\n"Mr Ford, you have still several factories in the Kingdom of Virginia. And not only Virginia. Louisiana, Mexico, and Deseret. Am I correct"\nFord liked that bold young man. He was strong, passionate, the model American man. He smiled, and quietly smoked a bit from his cigarette."Yes, indeed. And I know what you want from me"\n\nIn a few hours, the secret deal was signed: Ford would supply the war effort of Dixieland converting his factories across North America into weapon factories and smuggling to Virginia as much war materials as he could. In exchange, his properties in the North would be given back to him once the war was over. It is rumored Lindbergh and Ford spoked of... other things, not written in the signed final deal. But these are just rumours..."

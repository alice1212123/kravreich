 bourbon_king: "Bourbon King"
 bourbon_king_desc: "When the House of Bourbon finally accepted the loss of the Fatherland to the Corsican upstart at the Treaty of Amiens, Louis XVI, King of France, became Louis I, King of Louisiana. Louis III, like his royal ancestors, is a strong and energetic ruler, determined to maintain what little remains of the Ancien Régime. He has done much to modernise the Louisianian armed forces."
 fighting_king: "The Fighting King"
 fighting_king_desc: "Edward VIII ascended to the throne upon the death of his father, George V, on January 20th, 1936. He captured the popular imagination during the Great War as a daring Royal Flying Corps pilot, dogfighting the French over Calais. His diplomatic efforts to ease the humiliating peace conditions for the Commonwealth realms have done much to recuperate British loyalty to the Crown, shaken by George V's acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles."
 ottoman_emperor: "Sovereign of the Sublime House of Osman"
 ottoman_emperor_desc: "Mehmed VII, Caliph of Islam, Commander of the Faithful, Protector of the Two Holy Cities, is the reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He was almost overthrown after his incompetent advisors led the Empire to a pyrrhic victory in the Great War. After facing off against the Young Turks in a brief period of unrest verging on civil war, he agreed to relinquish some authority to the General Assembly to ensure stability and prevent the Empire being dismembered further by the circling vultures."
 swedish_king: "King of the United Kingdom of Sweden, Denmark and Norway"
 swedish_king_desc: "Gustav V is descended paternally from the Bernadotte and Oldenburg dynasties, the union of which merged the kingdoms of Sweden and Denmark-Norway. His reign has been more peaceful than that of his predecessor, Oscar II, who lost the duchy of Schleswig-Holstein to the German king of Westphalia. Gustav V kept Sweden out of the Great War and on good terms with both the Continental System and their Anglo-Russian enemies."
 duchess_luxembourg: "Grand Duchess"
 duchess_luxembourg_desc: "The House of Nassau-Weilburg was placed on the throne of Luxembourg during the peace negotiations surrounding the end of the Napoleonic Wars, as a French concession to British and Russian concerns over the size and industrial strength of the victorious French Empire. Marie-Adélaïde is not particularly popular as a monarch, performing her duties primarily as a French puppet rather than a unifier or representative of the people."
 american_king: "Hamiltonian King"
 american_king_desc: "The line of John II, the House of Hamilton, was not the Founding Fathers' first choice for king. However, George I Washington died without an heir, and Alexander I Hamilton was selected as sovereign by a Constitutional Convention. John II led America competently through the Great War, seizing many British possessions in the Western Hemisphere, and forging closer ties to the French Emperor, Napoleon IV. Like many of his ancestors, he tries to centralise power at the expense of the legislature, to the consternation of the Whigs."

 wettin_king_desc: "Augustus IV is a divisive monarch, to say the least. His ancestors, the Saxon Kings of Wettin, embraced their Polish identity after the loss of their German lands to pan-nationalists and Westphalian invasion. Augustus IV's credentials as a Polish patriot are not questioned: his competence is. As one of the chief instigators of the Central Powers' attack on Austria, radicals and democrats despise him for the bloodshed that followed. Many Poles remain loyal to him, however, for his attempts to bring glory to Poland."
 Pilsudski: "Józef Piłsudski"
 Pilsudski_desc: "Already a popular figure amongst Polish ultranationalists, Piłsudski's victories against Austria and Westphalia during the Great War also gave him and his Revival Front mainstream appeal. His huge mandate in the 1935 Sejm elections allowed him to declare a state of emergency and suspend democracy, with the conservatives and monarchists reluctantly agreeing. The Radicals and Democrats had discredited themselves by trying to overthrow the King during the Great War, and Piłsudski's Revival Front promises to smash Radicalism wherever it can be found, creating a new Europe with Poland at its head."
 emperor_puyi: "Emperor Puyi"
 emperor_puyi_desc: "The Xuantong Emperor was only an infant when the absolutist Qing monarchy was forced to cede temporal power to the legislature. However, he still has many advisors around him who talk of restoring the old ways. These corrupt provincial governors, bureacrats and officials were precisely the reason the Qing monarchy lost the support of the people. Now an adult and an accomplished politician and respected diplomat, he may yet win back legitimacy and reverse the trend towards constitutionalism."
 hu_hanmin: "Hu Hanmin"
 hu_hanmin_desc: "The republican movement which sought to topple Emperor Puyi quickly splintered when faced with the many problems they inherited from the monarchists. Threatened with intervention from the Taiping heathens and Japanese imperialists, a majority chose to reconcile with the Qing moderates and win their support, unifying the centrists and conservatives, while the absolutists and radical republicans were left in the cold. Hu Hanmin succeeded Sun Yat-sen as prime minister after the old revolutionist's death in 1925."

 sohn_seiner_klasse_desc: "Ernst Thälmann is President of Germany, head of the German Communist Party, and one of the central figures in the revolution that began in 1935 after the end of the Great War. The ability of the extreme left to organise on such a large scale surprised the monarchy, but Thälmann took advantage of the disillusionment amongst centrist democrats at the seemingly senseless war their king had thrown them into. Whether the Communists will be able to cement this support into a permanent coalition, or be overthrown in turn, remains to be seen."

 aryan_supremacist_desc: "Adolf Hitler is a popular speaker amongst far-right parties and militant groups. Before the Great War, he achieved notoriety for his outlandish theories on racial supremacy, which place Germanic peoples above others in an hierarchy, with Jewish and Slavic peoples at the bottom. In the multinational Austrian Empire, these were not popular beliefs, and he was never appointed or elected to office. He fought in the Great War as a non-commissioned officer in an Austrian regiment, winning many decorations for bravery, and inspiring the loyalty of a following of Great War veterans who now form the base of his support."
 aryan_chancellor: "Aryan Chancellor"
 aryan_chancellor_desc: "Adolf Hitler seized power in Austria with the help of far-right paramilitaries. His stated goal is the unification of all the Aryan peoples under one state, a Greater Austrian Reich. The racist policies he is implementing within Austria are creating a tiered caste system, with Jewish and Slavic peoples at the bottom."

 habsburg_emperor_desc: "Otto I is the reigning Emperor of Austria. After the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire by the Corsican Tyrant in 1806, the Austrian Empire became the source of Habsburg authority. Otto I led Austria through the recent Great War. Despite many losses in the early days to Poland, Hungary and Italy, he managed to defend his capital until help arrived from the French Emperor, Napoleon IV, who was eager to put the Central Powers back in their place and affirm French dominance of Europe. Otto's reliance on French assistance hurt his credibility amongst the people, but he is a ruthless ruler and competent administrator so the Empire remains stable."
 mormon_president: "Mormon President"
 mormon_president_desc: "Albert McKay is the 18th President of Deseret. The nation was forged by the merger of Mormon settlers fleeing persecution in America and Louisiana, Native American tribes pushed out of the Plains, and Yankee and Louisianan carpetbaggers who opposed the seemingly unending slavery in their native Kingdoms. The three groups often clashed over religion and land, but a Deseret identity grew out of their mutual struggles against Mexican and Louisianan encroachment. The government of Deseret continues to cultivate close ties with other peripheral nations, like the Algonquian and Chan Santa Cruz, but with the recent electoral success of the hardline Mormon Missionary Movement, this policy may change."
 mormon_prophet: "Prophet-President"
 mormon_prophet_desc: "Israel Madison Smith is the fourth Prophet-President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a position usually kept separate from the secular office of President of Deseret. The union of the Church and State presidencies is not unprecedented, but it is usually followed by civil unrest as the non-Mormon citizens become marginalised. Israel Smith is a descendent of Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, and holds strong beliefs about the role of his family as God's appointed regents on Earth."
 hungarian_regent: "Hungarian Regent"
 hungarian_regent_desc: "Field Marshal Horthy was selected as Regent for King Albert in his infancy by the Hungarian Diet, to ensure stability against radicalism. He continues in that role even after the Hungarian defeat in the Great War thanks to his immense popularity with the troops - although his armies were destroyed by the French late in the war, his early victories in Slovakia and Romania seemed to give him an aura of invincibility and lent credence to the boasts of 'home by Christmas'. After the war, Horthy was able to escape blame for defeat by passing it to the radicals and democrats who had opposed joining Poland in the attack on Austria."
 hungarian_king: "Hungarian King"
 hungarian_king_desc: "King Albert was far too young to lead Hungary into the Great War. His generals, with Field Marshal Horthy at their head, were responsible for this. The teenaged king was forced to watch his armies smash themselves to pieces against the might of the Continental System. Now that the Hungarian Diet's decision to appoint Horthy as Regent has expired, perhaps Hungary can be great once again."

 bomber_harris_desc: "Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris is a staunch advocate of strategic bombing as a means of extending Britain's imperial might. He saw the importance of air power in the Great War during which he achieved the rank of Air Marshal. He became an ally of Edward VIII during the prince's time in the Royal Flying Corps, and was soon drawn into, and disgusted by, the politicking of the government, which he saw as ineffective, weak and decadent."

 westphalian_king: "Westphalian King"
 westphalian_king_desc: "Frederick II is a descendent of Hieronymus, youngest brother of Napoleon. Westphalia was originally one constituent of a larger Confederation, but a centralised French puppet was easier to manage, and the other kings and dukes were dispossessed soon after the peace of 1817. Westphalia remained a loyal member of the Continental System, but German nationalism demanded special privileges, and the Westphalian kings were allowed to wage limited wars within the French sphere, seizing Saxony from the Wettin kings of Poland, and more recently Schleswig-Holstein from Sweden. The special favour the French Emperor showed to Germany hastened the disintegration of the Continental System, which culminated in the Great War. King Frederick is widely viewed as a weak leader, and the Radicals and ultranationalists used the upheaval as their chance to end French influence in Germany."

Accusations that the king is a French puppet are considered treasonous."
 life_hussar: "Life Hussar"
 life_hussar_desc: "August von Mackensen was formerly a senior general in the Westphalian army. Born a commoner, he was ennobled by Frederick II's father for his expertise as a cavalry commander. During the Great War, he helped break the trench stalemates with brilliant maneuver warfare, but was relieved of his command for anti-French sentiments. The dismissal of the popular general was a blow to the popularity of the monarchy, and the German ultranationalist movement began coalescing around Mackensen. The rebellion of the Radicals and Democrats gave them their opportunity to strike, and a mass defection of troops ensued. As Reichskanzler, Mackensen demands an end to French influence, annexation of Pomerania, and a return to traditional German values."
 huey_long: "Huey Long"
 huey_long_desc: "A populist from the Deep South, Huey Long rose to fame with a campaign promising to make 'every man a king', a dangerous statement in an absolute monarchy. He has a large and loyal following of expansionists, religious extremists and nationalists. As a Governor he acquired a reputation as an authoritarian, deploying local troops to disperse protests and passing many executive orders to circumvent the opposition of the state legislature."
 italian_king: "King of Italy"
 italian_king_desc: "Joachim III of the French dynasty of Murat is the nominal head of state of Italy. However, his secular power was largely usurped by the dictator Mussolini after the conclusion of the Great War. The House of Murat has waned in popularity over the years, with the public's initial euphoria over unification dampened by continued French possession of Corsica and Piedmont. The ultranationalist elements see the king as a modern day Tarquinius: a corrupt foreigner stymying Italy's growth, and they agitate for the formal removal of King Joachim and the rebirth of a Roman state, but thus far Mussolini has restrained them. Paradoxically, the pretence of the king having power will continue so long as he never attempts to exercise it."
 great_dictator: "Great Dictator"
 great_dictator_desc: "After the Sicilian riots nearly tore the Italian nation into two, many ended up losing faith in the ruling monarchy. At the time, the Murats were becoming much too comfortable with their strong French loyalty. This loyalty came at a price however, inflaming both Republican and Nationalist circles. In response the military, headed by Italo Balbo, took power and begun to crack down on the southern movements who seeked political change or worst, independence. While the Military have done much to maintain control, the changes that have occured have been only patchwork and if major reforms aren't made than Sicily and Naples may once again descend into chaos."
 heavenly_king: "Heavenly King of Great Peace"
 heavenly_king_desc: "Hong Dakai is a patrilineal descendent of the original Heavenly King (and 'Younger Brother of Christ') Hong Xiuquan, whose Millenarian Christian kingdom was created after a long and bloody struggle against the Qing. The final resolution of that conflict was prevented by European interventions, but the status quo cannot continue indefinitely. The Taiping state is strong enough now to seek its own destiny, without fear of the cowardly French or exhausted British. As the living embodiment of Christ on Earth, Hong Dakai demands that the northern Manchu barbarians recognise his divinity."
 rasputin: "Grigori Rasputin"
 black_monk: "The Black Monk"
 black_monk_desc: "Rasputin is the ageing influencer behind the Russian throne. A close friend and confidant to Empress Alexandra after winning her trust by healing her son, he effectively acted as regent for the young Alexander IV after Nicholas II's untimely death at the hands of Jacobin assassins. Although he has deep spiritual authority amongst the peasants, he is despised by the Russian nobility for monopolising influence, by the government ministers and civil service for promoting his incompetent favourites, and by the trades unionists and liberals for seeking to roll back political and social reforms." 
 emperor_russia: "Emperor of All the Russias"
 emperor_russia_desc: "Alexander IV was born in 1904 to the liberal reformer Nicholas II, making him a great grandson of Queen Victoria of England. Although he inherited his father's Anglophilia, he also inherited the royal disease, haemophilia, and the many treatments his increasingly desperate parents attempted culminated in the person of Grigori Rasputin, with his spirit healing and seances. Rasputin became a second father to Alexander IV after Nicholas II was assassinated by Jacobins in 1912, and the liberal reforms of his father became seen by the new Autocrat as capitulations to murderers. Under the influence of the Black Monk, Alexander IV dissolved the Duma and sought to destroy the neighbouring republics carved out of Russia's flanks by Napoleon, but the incompetently led Russian army met disaster and rebellion at the hands of the Balts, Belarusians and Ukrainians."

They lead peasants in activities they perceive as strengthening the Romanov government in Russia. While they see themselves as a bulwark against revolutionaries, they are better known for launching pogroms - murdering and terrorising Jews in rural areas and small towns where the liberals and socialists are weak. Vostorgov himself is the Dean of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow and a rival of Rasputin."

 macarthur_desc: "Douglas MacArthur is one of the most popular American generals. He was an hero during the Great War, winning the battle of the Bermuda generally considered the turning point of the war against the British Empire. MacArthur joined the revolution given his distrust of the king, but he also doesn't want a socialist state in America. His personal plan for America is a mighty empire lead by a strong nationalistic people where common men and big corporations work together for the benefit of everyone. A strong emphasis is put on the role of the army."
 ford_desc: "Henry Ford is probably the most successful businessman in all of America. A suthern hardcore corporatist, he wishes to turn America in a corporate state where the people and the industries will work together in peace. Of course to achieve this goal Ford will use every necessary mean, even if it means brutal violence and outright murder of union leaders."
 emp_macarthur_desc: "Douglas MacArthur has risen from regular general to Emperor of the American Empire; as his imperialistic ambitions have become clear, the American nation has entered a new era of expansion and strengthening."
 wallace_desc: "Henry Wallace is a moderate Republican that has become a prominent leader of Anarchist and Unionist movements in America. Now that he has secured the role of president, it is sure that America will enter a period of democratization and reconciliation with the monarchist."
 browder_desc: "Earl Browder is a hardline marxist politician. His strong anti-monarchist and anti-longist retoric has brought Browder a lot of fame and support between the most ardent revolutionaries. However many people see his reforms as a threat to their way of life, and it is sure that his presidency will upset many voters of the democratic party, that now risks a massive purge."
 emperor_napoleon_weak: "Shadow Emperor"
 emperor_napoleon_weak_desc: "Democratic and democratic forces inside the French government have greatly reduced the role of the Emperor inside France. With Napoléon capitulating to the "will of the people" he has decided to become a simple figurehead and symbol of the nation; after centuries of active rule from the Boubons and the Bonaparte it seems like the ideals of the French Revolution have prevailed and France is now a fully constitutional monarchy."
 emperor_napoleon_defeated: "The Emperor of Ashes"
 emperor_napoleon_defeated_desc: "Napoléon IV has never been a very reactionary monarch, always trying to stay popular with the people and usually obeying to their will. However the Second French Revolution seems to have proven that the Bonaparte's costitutionalism has failed, causing the Emperor to enter into a period of heavy depression. Napoléon IV was already scarred by the horrors to the great war, and his exile has only striked the last blow."
 pierre_laval_pm: "Prime Minister Pierre Laval"

 emperor_napoleon_middle_desc: "Napoléon IV promised to defened the French people and constitution at any cost, and has accepted a decrease of his power to prevent tyranny to ever taint France again in the future. With the emperor popular with both the people and most political forces, he is really the symbol of French unity and strength in the world."

 charles_degaulle_pm: "Prime Minister Charles DeGaulle"
 charles_degaulle_pm_desc: "Charles DeGaulle has become Prime Minister of France.

 philippe_petain_pm_almost_desc: "Now Interior and Defence minister Philippe Petain has gained even more power, promising an empowerment of the army and the gendarmeries to crush any enemy of our nation. While this militaristic revival is ongoign, Laval is playing his own political game to create a strong, stable and conservative France."
 france_pm_tardieu: "Minister Tardieu"
 france_pm_tardieu_desc: "Laval has reshuffled the Franch cabinet, appointing André Tardieu as a sort of "Minister of Everything." He, at least in theory, should manage both the Defence and the Finances sectors, but everybod knows how a manipolable and weak politician Tardieu is. It seems likely the whole French government is in the hands of Laval now..."
 charles_maurras_pm: "Prime Minister Charles Maurras"
 charles_maurras_pm_desc: "The reactionary leader of Action Francaise, Charles Maurras, has become the Prime Minister of France. A devout catholic and stunch anti-socialist, Maurras is disliked by many people in our country; he is suspected of Bourbon sympathies and has often exposed his hate for the Bonaparte family, but his personal dislike of the Emperor won't stop him from trying to turn France into a reactionary and monarchist country."
 philippe_henriot_pm: "Co-Prime Minister Philippe Henriot"
 philippe_henriot_pm_desc: "The unthinkable has happened. Anti-semite Philippe Henriot, a stunch catholic and enemy of everything democratic, has become Co-Prime Minister of France, together with champion of the old order Charles Maurras. Henriot and his party don't actually like Maurras, prefering a national-syndicalist economic system together with catholic values, but the charismatic journalist will do anything to enforce his personal idea of France, and he may well succeed in his schemes..."

 emperor_napoleon_puppet: "Silent Emepror"
 emperor_napoleon_puppet_desc: "With Petain's junta firmly in control, the Emperor has been relegated to a role of silence. Napoleon IV has been transformed into a simbol of national unity, while the military quietly pulls the strings of the country and prepares for new moves on the world stage."
 france_petain_idealized_sovreign: "National Hero"
 france_petain_idealized_sovreign_desc: "It may seem like a miracle, but Petain's propaganda has managed to reshape the image of the emperor from a weak and liberal man into the true hero of the French nation. Propaganda art pieces depict the emperor bravely serving at the front, leading his troops and gloriously guiding his people to victory. Napoleon may not completely like this rebranding, but it is now clear that he's simply a shiny toy for the true masters of France: Petain and the shady figures that stand behind him."
 france_louis_marin_pm: "Prime Minister Louis Marin"
 france_louis_marin_pm_desc: "Louis Marin has been for a long time a stunch conservative inside the Party of Order.

With great bloodshed we were able to crush the revolution, however the spectre of socialism still hunts Britian to this day.

 church_pm_desc: "Following a tense campaign, ultra-loyalist and flamboyant conservative Winston Churchill has managed to secure his position as the new British PM.

 throsby_desc: "General Bridges has a complex history when it comes to the ruling of Oceania. He is seen by many as a war hero who's loyalty lies strictly with the British Empire and by many as an autocratic individual who continously revokes democratic principles and ideals. Born in the famous Australian city of Melbourne he soon made his way into the Australian army to help with Britians war efforts over in Europe. Leaving the battlefields of africa as a defeated but glorified general he soon took advantage of the New Zealand workers strike, requesting Britians blessing in stationing troops in the small dominion and eventually outright annexing it into Australia's fold. Thus starting the first chapter in Oceania's history. "

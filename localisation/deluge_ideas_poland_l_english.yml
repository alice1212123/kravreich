POL_frze:0 "Political Gridlock"
POL_frze_desc:0 "The Dependency's usefulness is quickly expiring. A collective of some of Polands brightest minds and devout Ultra-nationalists first introduced only a year after Łukasiewicz's coup is starting to become an ever consuming political virus. While in theory Łukasiewicz is head of state and has final say on matters every new law or alteration to existing ones must be over seen with the Dependency's approval. Łukasiewicz deeply regrets bringing such a system to light even if it was to please the various nationalist groups that called Poland home. It is quite clear to say that their existence as a political entity is soon to cease."

Poland has no interest in becoming another nation to fall victim to the so called "Red Tide". Poland sees herself as the bulwark against the Jacobite and Marxist hordes to the East."

POL_peace:0 "Polish Revanchism" 
POL_peace_desc:0 "For over a century, France has been the master of Europe. Of its many client states, Poland has been one of its most loyal allies. The Polish people felt as though they owed a debt to Napoleon and his Empire after he had saved them from humiliation and occupation. Unsurprisingly, this feeling was not reciprocated by their French overlord. Poland has constantly been used as cannon fodder by France in the east during times of war. With the toppling of the old order in Poland, many within our country now demand that France be placated by Poland."

 america1title: "The Commonwealth Of America"
 america1desc: "During the final days of the American revolution an english redcoat brought death upon our beloved George Washington. The subsquent result was an Oligarchical republic speer headed by the Founding Fathers with a mix of European nobility. Today, America stands as one of the few nations of the modern world who have adopted the ideas of democracy. Although, some would argue we more closely resemble a monarchy, with no executive term limits and Washington's descendants acting, de facto, as our royal family. Needless to say the current political sphere of the Commonwealth is a violent battle between the old order an the new."

 america2title: "A Voice Beyond The White House"
 america2desc: "Today Mr Wallace could be seen openly talking with the public. Economic policies and Political agendas were all to popular especially when the topic of a "True Republic" was mentioned. Wallace charismatically addressed his views on such a topic. "Dear fellow Americans I to dream about the days where your words truely hold weight." "When the common man could hold more power than his capitalist brothers." "Though the bureaucrats in Congress would say otherwise." "We must strive for a new America, A Free America!" And the crowds roared in agreement."

 america4title: "A Neutral Military"
 america4desc: "If the military involve themselves in political affairs then a civil war could be a possible outcome of Wallace's reforms.

If all goes well than a stable America is all but assured even if Wallace fails in his endeavours."

 america5title: "Big Buisiness Agreements"
 america5desc: "Around America meetings were held in secret with various corporations and local buisness with Mr Wallace. In exchange for their full support for Wallaces attempts at reforming America they would be granted economic privileges once the reconstruction of America's political sphere was complete. Having such an influential collection of elites will prove vital for Wallace's free America."

 america6title: "Influential Press"
 america6desc: "Slowly Congress has been restricting what the press can and cannot say. State Press seems to be the next step unless change happens and change is what Wallace promises to the various news organisations of America. All he asks in return is for them to disobey Congress's wishes and post the truth. Their lies, all of it."

 america10title: "The Future Of War"
 america10desc: "The American military lacks a doctrine to abide by. Both tanks and calvary still serve together and some of our greatest military minds have demanded a major reform be under taken. The result of this back and forth between generals is a tense atmosphere within every military meeting. Each side demands that the american government either chooses for them or America shall be left defenseless and vunerable for attack."

 america11desc: "Can you hear it? The sounds of street parades and music play all throughout this mighty America as every citizen poor and rich celebrate the reformation of the American political sphere. Congress once filled with fervently corrupt individuals now stands truimphant as a true system of democratic rule. The election of 1939 is a guaranteed win for Mr Wallace and he will undoubtedly lead America into it's first golden age. America's Manifest Destiny, he calls it."

 america12desc: "It seemed impossible, truely. A king of America? A nightmare to some and a dream to others whatever the case may be one thing for sure is that Mackenzie has alot of work to do if he is to keep his newly founded empire together and free from liberal tyranny. One can only imagine what the point of the American revolution was, entirely pointless? Afterall the only major democracy in the world has found itself drifting to monarchism to."

 america13title: "The American Election"
 america13desc: "Even though Henry has done much to alter the American political landscape he has ultimately failed in his great crusade. In his place the American gentleman, Franklin D. Roosevelt. He seeks to restore conservative values to America and enforce a more hardline approach when it comes to dealing with radicals."

 america14title: "Assuring Investors"
 america14desc: "Many major corporate heads and big business men are concerned of the future of their monopolies. Though Wallace has done much for them they are still concerned for the wellbeing of their empires. Mr Wallace has planned to meet with a vast portion of America's corporations and ensure that they know they have Wallace's trust and assurance. The time for corruption is no more and they shall know that this new America will not only be a free America, but a corporate one to."

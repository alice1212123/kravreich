 LE_DELUGE: "Après Moi, Le Déluge"
 LE_DELUGE_DESC: "Today marks the 70th year since the outbreak of the Republican Revolutions.\nThe Continental System established by Napoleon weathered the storm, battered but victorious. The malcontents of the world licked their wounds and bided their time. Radicals and Republicans, Jacobins and Nationalists, all watched for signs of weakness.\nToday, the strength of the Continental System will be tested once again."

 FRA_DELUGE_DESC: "The Empire established by Napoleon was supposed to civilise the world, bringing peace to Europe and glory to France. It succeeded for a hundred years, but the peace was shattered in the most traumatising way imaginable. Once the Great War had been won by France just a few short years ago, and the English and Russians, her perpetual enemies, were humiliated, half a generation of men lay in shallow graves stretching from Calais to Romania. The trauma of the loss of the cream of French manhood weighs heavily on the Fatherland, even as the embers still flicker in the ruined nations of loser and victor alike."
 SOV_DELUGE_DESC: "When Europe descended into bloody conflict a decade ago, the Russian Empire saw its chance to right past wrongs. The old border realms along the French sphere of influence had been carved from Russia's flanks by the hated Napoleon a century ago, and now they would be reabsorbed. But the fickle nationalisms of the Baltic, the Ukraine and the Caucasus denied Russia her destiny once again, laying low the mighty Russian armies. Soon, the sorrow of the bereaved widows of the Great War will pass and the anger of the next generation of warriors will take its place."
 ENG_DELUGE_DESC: "Britain has sometimes seen herself as separate from Europe, as being self-contained in splendid isolation. This attitude was recently put aside when the French vulture sought to feast on the carrion of yet more imperial conquests. Italy, Poland and Hungary were finally breaking free from the talons gripping them, and the British lion would be their guarantor. For his compassion, the lion was butchered on the beaches of Dunkirk. For his benevolence, the lion had his claws torn out by the Treaty of Versailles. The lion is not a stupid beast, and he has learned the mistakes of compassion and benevolence when dealing with vultures."
 CHI_DELUGE_DESC: "The Qing monarchy is ancient, but the current government is a recent innovation.\nAfter a series of disasters lasting a century, from floods and earthquakes to famine and rebellion, the monarchy was almost spent. Merchants, generals and revolutionists gave the Emperor an ultimatum: cede temporal power to a competent legislature who would put an end to the disasters, or face destruction.\nThe Emperor chose to become a moral figurehead, and the disasters ended.\nThere is still much lost ground to be recovered."
 DDR_DELUGE_DESC: "Germany has long been the battlefield of Europe. Bourbons and Habsburgs. Protestants and Catholics. Empires and monarchies. Again and again, Germany became the bloody arena of the sovereigns. The long suffering people of Germany have finally had enough. The Great War left the empires and monarchies exhausted, and the German people have seized the chance to throw off their puppet king, their thieving aristocrats, their lying priests and all the other parasites. All over the world, the hungry and abused are rallying against the lords and ladies. Germany will win her freedom and lead them."
 POL_DELUGE_DESC: "When Napoleon restored the ancient kingdom of Poland as his puppet, he understood the passion Poles have for their fatherland. He exploited it. Did he understand that passion would not be satisfied with subservience to a foreign empire? His ancestor today does not understand. The French and their puppets in Austria and Germany think they taste victory, but Poland will never die. Their victory will turn sour in their mouths. The weaklings and cowards occupying Wilno and Minsk will be the first to taste it, but not the last."
 USA_DELUGE_DESC: "The Europeans have made dashing their own brains out their favourite pastime. Whether for the prestige of emperors or the lunacy of republicans, the fools have never missed a chance to kill and maim one another. The illustrious House of Hamilton has usually been content to watch them have at it. Only when their savagery spills over into the Western Hemisphere does America intervene. The spoils are rarely worth the effort. Good King John protected the realm from the worst of the Great War, but now the fools are at it again."
 ITA_DELUGE_DESC: "Time and again in the Great War, we charged the Austrian lines at the Isonzo, but our weak and cowardly leaders were not up to the task. We fared better against the French and pushed them back to the Savoyard mountains, but once our allies in the Central Powers had been defeated, it was only a matter of time before Italy was forced to negotiate a surrender. Perhaps King Joachim betrayed us? The House of Murat were installed by Napoleon, after all. We should look for an older pedigree to save Italy."
 GER_DELUGE_DESC: "The French swept through Europe so many years ago that the order they created has become accepted without question. No longer! We will depose the foolish French puppet-king who led us to slaughter in the Great War. We will retake land lost in our forefathers' day. We will build a Germany worthy of the legacy of the old Reich!"
 WGR_DELUGE_DESC: "Stability and peace are worthy goals, but when traitors and rebels take up arms against their masters, justice demands that they be relentlessly crushed. The democrats, radicals and nationalists have declared themselves agents of chaos. They say the king is a puppet of France and an incompetent fool besides. Nothing could be further from the truth! The intricacies of international co-operation are simply beyond the grasp of philistines and traitors. Now they will see that God favours King Frederick, as we turn to Ultima Ratio Regum."
 TUR_DELUGE_DESC: "The Muslim world was once the centre of culture and learning, in the dark centuries following the fall of Rome to the European barbarians. Turkey took up the mantle of leader of the Muslim peoples and became the crowning glory of Islam, before beginning her long collapse. Thanks to the Caliph's recent successes against Russia, we hope to have finally stemmed the bleeding.\nPerhaps we are no longer the Sick Man of Europe, and can restore Turkey to her former glory."
 AUS_DELUGE_DESC: "Napoleon's conquests were at the expense of many empires and kingdoms, but Austria was especially harmed. Losing Hungary, Lombardy, Croatia and Galicia left the Habsburg realm a shadow of its former self. Many believed the empire would be toppled by revolution or outside conquest, but we found strength in loyalty to the crown.\nOur former subjects tried to finish us off in the Great War. The mass graves they now reside in are testament to their foolishness."
 JAP_DELUGE_DESC: "For many centuries, the European empires sneered at Japan, considering us subhuman and untrustworthy. Only the constant vigilance of the Emperor and his loyal Shogun kept the barbarians at bay. After we had adopted the Europeans' weapons of war and mastered their use, we became equals to the Europeans in their eyes, but we will not forget their past treachery. We must secure Japan's future by establishing our own Empire, and acquiring the resources for our industries while the Europeans continue their bickering."
 SWE_DELUGE_DESC: "The Scandinavian monarchies were united after Napoleon's conquests by marriage. Denmark and Sweden are too weak to stand alone against all the tyrants of Europe, but we can protect ourselves if we work together. Still, there is much room for reclaiming lost land, if we can find the opportunity. The Duchy of Holstein was seized by Germany, but the German king has incited revolution against his incompetent reign. Finland was lost to Russia, and yearns for freedom. The British are on the back foot after losing decisively to France.\nOr we could enjoy the peace while it lasts."
 LOU_DELUGE_DESC: "The Kingdom of Louisiana was created from the remaining colonial possessions of the Bourbon kings of France. After Louis XVI fled from the bloodthirsty Jacobins, he fought alongside the various ill-fated Coalitions that sought to destroy Napoleon and restore the Ancien Régime, but to no avail. In 1817, the wars ended and the Bourbons were forced to adjust to their less glamorous realm. However, times are changing. The old French Empire is no longer the force it once was. We have many opportunies to seize upon."
 PRC_DELUGE_DESC: "The Chinese people have been occupied by heathen Manchu barbarians for many centuries now. Hong Xiuquan, our Heavenly King of Great Peace, came to us in our time of need to save us from the Qing monarchy and restore justice to the world. Though He has since returned to His place at the side of his elder brother, Jesus Christ, His work continues here on earth in the capable hands of His descendents. Hong Dakai, the wise and just, will lead us to final victory over the Qing barbarians and establish peace on earth for eternity."

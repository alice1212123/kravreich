 radical_germany1title: "Growing Factionalism"
 radical_germany1desc: "The Communist party had been a somewhat secretive combination of various, loosely aligned political associations under the Kingdom of Westphalia. But both the power and prominence of the party has increased explosively with the outbreak of the civil war, and as many now see a radical victory as a possible outcome, members from all corners of the ideological spectrum will be throwing their hats in the ring to be able to shape the nature of Germany. To the victors go the spoils..."

 radical_germany2title: "Extension of War Measures"
 radical_germany2desc: "Representants of the General Staff have approached the Politbureau, proposing some more stringent measures to strengthen the national war effort. Multiple members of the political class have already come out against these proposals, calling them unnecessary and describing them as 'threatening the well-being of the populace', while others support the policies as a way to bring a quick end to the war. A large number of those in support of the proposals also happen to be influential members of the military."
 radical_germany2opta: "The needs of the army are greater than those of the civilians."
 radical_germany2optb: "We won't sacrifice our people to the military!"
 radical_germany3title: "Expand Conscription"
 radical_germany3desc: "Another proposal from the leading heads of the military has reached the ears of the Politbureau. It states that, in order to win the civil war, the size of the military will have to increased, mostly by the way of increasing the laws of conscription. Again, these measures have come to quickly polarize the debate into those who think them necessary, and those who take them to be untennable. Yet, as the war rages on, more radical proposals might begin to seem more reasonable."

 radical_germany8title: "Ernst Thälmann assassinated!"
 radical_germany8desc: "Late last night, while the President was en route to his private residence after a session with the Volkskammer, his entourage came under attack from masked gunmen. The sudden attack caught the security forces off guard and the assailants managed to escape after striking the President twice. An hour ago, aides at the hospital informed us that the President has succumbed to his wounds.\n\nThis blow has shocked the government, as we have lost the guiding leader of the revolution. The Politbureau is still in talks to decide upon a successor, while the security forces are interrogating bystanders arrested at the scene of the crime to find some clue as to the identity of the perpetrators."

 radical_germany11opt: "We didn't have anything to do with it! ... Right?"
 radical_germany12title: "The Assassins Were Anarchists!"
 radical_germany12desc: "The [Root.Capital.GetName] section chief of the security forces has accused a local anarchist cell of carrying out the assassination of President Ernst Thälmann. He says that the culprits have already been arrested and interrogated, and several have confessed to helping organise the political murder in order to 'punish the Party for betraying the revolution'."
 radical_germany12opta: "Pass a ban on all Anarchist Organizations!"

 radical_germany13title: "The Anarchists Were Framed!"
 radical_germany13desc: "The security chief responsible for arresting the [Root.Capital.GetName] anarchists has admitted to fabricating evidence and torturing suspects into confessions. One of his aides approached the national office with proof of his deception and an internal investigation followed which dismantled the case against the anarchists. The section chief has been stripped of his rank and has plead guilty to charges of subverting the course of justice."

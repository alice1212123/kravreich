 DDR_six_stage_plan: "The Six Stage Plan"
 DDR_six_stage_plan_desc: "The leading heads of the German Politbureau have formulated a document conveying guidelines on how the Revolution will be implemented. While this document carries the spirit of their ideology, many details are yet to be decided upon, and the task of deciding on the final wording will have to be completed throughout the next few years if we are to maintain our social momentum.\n"
 ssp_agrarian_economy: "Agrarian Protectionism"
 ssp_agrarian_economy_desc: "The farmers of Germany form the foundation of its people. A strong people need a strong agriculture, and a strong agriculture will provide for a strong people. State protectionism for our peasant class will create the necessary basis for a strong nation."
 ssp_industrial_economy: "Industrialisation"
 ssp_industrial_economy_desc: "The politbureau has concluded that the German industrial base must grow quickly in order to match the national ambition. A new program of rapid industrial development must be implemented if our socialist ideals are to prevail."
 ssp_militarist_economy: "War Socialism"
 ssp_militarist_economy_desc: "The burgeoise plot has been foiled, but the remaining class enemies must be hunted down and defeated! The attack on our nation has left our lands scarred and devastated, but our resolve has never been stronger. In order to ensure our security and contuing stability, the national economy will be reorganized to serve the revolutionary vanguard, for a safe and secure society."
 ssp_agrarian_ownership: "Communal Property"
 ssp_agrarian_ownership_desc: "The peasants working the land will have an intricate understanding of how best to exploit it. The establishment of localised rural co-operatives will be in the best interest of both the people and the state."
 ssp_industrial_ownership: "Nationalisation"
 ssp_industrial_ownership_desc: "In order to prevent the robber barons from undermining the working man's effort, the means of production must be placed under the wise guidance of the Socialist state. For the well-being of country and people, we need to ensure harmonious conditions."
 ssp_militarist_ownership: "Military Administration"
 ssp_militarist_ownership_desc: "If Socialism is to survive, we must sacrifice some of our own wealth. \nOr, more specifically, the people's wealth. \nTo the army."
 ssp_agrarian_politics: "Local Democracy"
 ssp_agrarian_politics_desc: "The people rightfully deserve to have a say in the runnings of their commune. It should be guaranteed that our citizens have the ability to elect a local representative of their choosing, as long as the party still gets to manage the bigger picture."
 ssp_industrial_politics: "Stratification"
 ssp_industrial_politics_desc: "The great project of Socialism simply cannot be left to the common man to oversee. To truly achieve class equality, the powers of state must be able to see to every man's needs, not just to a singular frame."
 ssp_militarist_politics: "The Voting Soldier"
 ssp_militarist_politics_desc: "The state's survival depends entirely on the success of the revolutionary army. To serve its interests, as well as to encourage the people to volunteer, popular suffrage will from now on be restricted to army personnel only."
 ssp_agrarian_social_order: "Traditional Values"
 ssp_agrarian_social_order_desc: "The traditional family dynamic and division of labour found in our rural communities represents equality in the truest sense. Our state must strive to make these values the new ideal in all parts of society."
 ssp_industrial_social_order: "Absolute Equality"
 ssp_industrial_social_order_desc: "Just like the members of the proletariat, the woman has long been caged by the corrupted and antiquated customs imposed by the burgeoise. It is the duty of the Socialist society to break these chains, and to achieve true equality in all aspects!"
 ssp_militarist_social_order: "To Serve the State"
 ssp_militarist_social_order_desc: "Neither the values of old nor the new ambition of equality manage to accurately represent the actual values of our new state. Both man and woman have their place, a purpose to fulfill, to best serve the state."
 ssp_agrarian_judiciary: "Communal Courts"
 ssp_agrarian_judiciary_desc: "Respecting the local customs, it is best to leave the intricacies of communal disputes to a locally assembled court. Both the dynamic nature and the regional autonomy are sure to be appreciated by the people."
 ssp_industrial_judiciary: "Political Supervision"
 ssp_industrial_judiciary_desc: "While it is important for a constitutional state to maintain a rule of law to resolve disputes, it is important to make sure that the ideas of our judiciary never stray too far from official party doctrine. \nSuch seperation would only ever lead to destabilizing conflict if not properly contained."
 ssp_militarist_judiciary: "Special Tribunals"
 ssp_militarist_judiciary_desc: "Maintaining a powerful state of law will only act as an eternal constraint on the army's ability to protect the people. The establishment of special tribunals ('Sonderausschüsse') will be more than enough to deal with the occasional straggler."
 ssp_agrarian_assimilation: "Rural Resettlement"
 ssp_agrarian_assimilation_desc: "We already have a need for capable men to work our land. It truly is a pleasant byproduct, then, if through the resettlement of national minorities the process of cultural assimilation is simultaneously encouraged."
 ssp_industrial_assimilation: "The Melting Pot"
 ssp_industrial_assimilation_desc: "The city has always acted as a place for multiple cultures to meet and intermingle. These centers of population will be the living engines of a new homogenous German culture, strengthening our nation for evermore."
 ssp_militarist_assimilation: "Assimilation through Service"
 ssp_militarist_assimilation_desc: "There will always be such elements in our state that would not see it as the just construct it truly is. Integrating these into the army as auxilliaries will imberse them with a new spirit of comradery, and show them the benefits of our new Socialist culture."
